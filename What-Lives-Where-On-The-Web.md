It might be a little daunting, first looking at Exim, to know what's where. This is largely because things are in flux.

## Main Website

This is [www.exim.org](https://www.exim.org) and contains online copies of the documentation and links to many more resources.

## Wiki

In the past, this has been on [wiki.exim.org](http://wiki.exim.org/) as a Moin-Moin powered wiki.  We lacked the human resources to adequately protect that from spammers and the install had fallen into a state of disrepair.  We switched to Github for our wiki provisioning, which is presumably where you're reading this now.

## Bug-tracking

This is hosted at [bugs.exim.org](https://bugs.exim.org/).

## Source Code

The [master copy](https://git.exim.org/exim.git) and developer public trees are available at [git.exim.org](https://git.exim.org/).

We have set up GitHub alongside exim.org, so that in the event of failure of the master site, an existing site with established reputation as a &ldquo;_legitimate_&rdquo; copy of the Exim code will be available for people to trust.

## Discussion

As Exim is a Mail Transfer Agent, it is perhaps unsurprising that most discussion takes place on [Exim Mailing Lists](EximMailingLists).

## Social Media

We are currently experimenting with the use of some social media outlets as a way of pushing out notifications which are more inclusive than our messages to the exim-announce mailing-list, but still generally of a broadcast approach.

Phil P has [mentioned release candidates and releases on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23Exim%20from%3Asyscomet) (which might yield no results if there have been no recent RCs or releases).

We had a [Google Plus brand page](https://plus.google.com/101257968735428844827/posts) but that service is shutting down.
