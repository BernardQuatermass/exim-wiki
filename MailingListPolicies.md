Mailing List Policies
=====================

Details of policies applied to the
[EximMailingLists](EximMailingLists). You will also find it
instructive to read [MailingListEtiquette](MailingListEtiquette) for
the social rules used on the list.

Archiving
---------

All the lists are archived. All the archives, except that for
*exim-maintainers* are public.

Posting to the list is taken as permission to post the message to the
archive, additionally you are informed when joining the list that the
list is publically archived.

Requests to have information removed from the archives are not welcomed
as they create significant work for maintainers and are a rewriting of
history. In cases of accidental exposure of confidential information
archive removal will be looked at, however many other sites also archive
our lists and removing exposed information can never be fully effective.

Posting
-------

All lists require you to be a member to post directly (except
*exim-announce* which is fully moderated). A non-member posting to the
list will find that their posting is moderated.

Posts that look like spam, have too many addresses in the To/Cc headers,
are from suspect addresses etc may also be moderated.

### Moderated Posts

*This policy has changed in October 2006 - this information reflects
current policy*
-   No message is sent to a user who has a post held for moderation
    (this is to prevent backscatter spam)
-   Moderators are given a summary of held messages once a day - they
    can then allow moderated messages through.
-   Thus a moderated message *just disappears* for a while. This is not
    a good situation but cannot be improved without full time moderators
    or without creating backscatter spam).

Please do not resend moderated requests *unless* you realise that the
original was from an unsubscribed address - in this case you may find
the original gets posted too since moderators do not necessarily
remember every message that has hit the list.
