I answer quite a lot of questions on the Exim mailing list. Most of my
experience comes from desigining and operating mail rewriting and
scanning hubs for medium-sized operations - up to single-thousand
domains. I've also participated in the design of ISP-scale mail systems
for several UK ISPs.

My favourite Exim topics are ACLs, [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com)
integration, [Exiscan](http://duncanthrax.net/exiscan-acl) and ways of
integrating external functionality using
[\${readsocket](http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.40/doc/html/spec_11.html#IX834)
and so on.

I'm collecting ideas for improvements to the Exim website
