Release Candidate verification status for Exim version 4.76

SECURITY CRITICAL RELEASE per
[EximReleasePolicyProposedDraft](EximReleasePolicyProposedDraft)

There will *not* be a full week between this release and the final
release.

We attempt to work with OS packagers who work with us, but time does not
permit us to chase up to get a response from the OSes listed here. The
template version of this document includes those OSes who wish to be
contacted for a new release. Packagers signing off on a particular
release may add themselves here and to the template for future releases,
as they see fit.

We also like testing from people who actively use an operating-system,
but are unlikely to chase after them for a response.

Table mostly sorted alphabetically by OS; specific versions after the
general case or "official maintainer"

<!-- This abuse warning was while we were fighting a creaking old wiki setup prone to spam and other abuse and is not really germane to GitHub, where we have persistent identities with reputation attached.

**Abuse**

Abuse of the wiki authorisation model will lead to an upset Release
Engineer and probably a disinclination to work with that party in the
future.
