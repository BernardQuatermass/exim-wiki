We are currently experimenting with the use of some social media outlets as a way of pushing out notifications which are more inclusive than our messages to the exim-announce mailing-list, but still generally of a broadcast approach.

Phil P has [mentioned release candidates and releases on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23Exim%20from%3Asyscomet) (which might yield no results if there have been no recent RCs or releases).

We have a [Google Plus brand page](https://plus.google.com/101257968735428844827/posts).

(what else?)
