Mailing List Statistics
=======================

Sizes
-----

As of 3 September 2007, the main lists had the following number of
members (some of these could be set to *nomail*, but its a reasonable
approximation as some are also feeding mailing list expanders).
-   exim-announce - *1737* members
-   exim-users - *1957* members
-   exim-dev - *210* members

The total number of unique members across these 3 lists are 3802, 240 of
these are currently set *nomail [these figures are a month old - we have
just dropped 500 undeliverable users from the announce list]*
