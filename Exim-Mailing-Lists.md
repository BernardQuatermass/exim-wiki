# Exim Mailing Lists

There are several mailing lists related to Exim. We suggest everyone subscribes the the `exim-announce` list to obtain information on updates and other issues that affect all Exim users. You may also wish to join one or more of the other lists.

To make the lists useful for everyone and to get the best use of them please read the notes on [[Mailing List Etiquette]] before posting.

Some stats on the lists are being collected at [[Exim Mailing List Stats]]

The master website's information on mailing-lists is at http://www.exim.org/maillist.html (and a little more limited, but more concise).

## `exim-announce@exim.org`

This is a very low traffic announcements only list. We strongly suggest that all users of Exim subscribe to this list. The list info page is at http://lists.exim.org/mailman/listinfo/exim-announce and searchable archives are at:

* http://lists.exim.org/lurker/list/exim-announce.en.html
* http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.mail.exim.announce

If you have an exim relevant announcement you may post to this list, but the post will be moderated, and may be rejected. Please remember the moderators do not work on this 24/7 so you may have to wait for a moderation decision - post in good time for time critical posts.

For extra dissemination of notice of release candidates and other events which do not meet our criteria for posting to `exim-announce`, not only do we post to `exim-users`, but we also use some [[Social Media]] approaches to getting the message out.

## `exim-users@exim.org`

This is a high traffic general list for all levels of user, with both a normal and digest form of the list available. The list info page is at http://lists.exim.org/mailman/listinfo/exim-users and searchable archives are at:

* http://lists.exim.org/lurker/list/exim-users.en.html
* http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.mail.exim.user

The list is open for posting from members. Non members postings or spammy postings are moderated. Members that are not following [[Mailing List Etiquette]] may be moderated for a while.  Alas, problems with spammers have led to a policy that new members will also be moderated, at least until the moderators see a couple of non-spam posts and clear the moderate bit. We regret that this proved necessary.

If you have questions about Exim or things you want to do with or to Exim this is where you should be posting. If you are using Exim version 3 then take note of [Exim3 Status]]. If you are using a debian distribution you may find that the specific debian mailing lists are better suited - see [[Debian Exim4]].

Please look at the information on [[Mailing List Etiquette]] before posting.

This is a (currently) low traffic general list about future development of exim, with both a normal and digest form of the list available. The list info page is at http://lists.exim.org/mailman/listinfo/exim-dev and searchable archives are at:

* http://lists.exim.org/lurker/list/exim-dev.en.html
* http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.mail.exim.devel

The list does not take bug reports: please check on `exim-users` to confirm your understanding of the issues and that there's not an overlooked configuration option to help you, before filing a bug in [[BugZilla]].

Please look at the information on [[Mailing List Etiquette]] before posting.

## `exim-cvs@exim.org`

Git checkins list (demonstrating the lack of wisdom in embedding current technology choices into the list name, thank you 20/20 hindsight), with both a normal and digest form of the list available. The list info page is at http://lists.exim.org/mailman/listinfo/exim-cvs and searchable archives are at http://lists.exim.org/lurker/list/exim-cvs.en.html

There are no posts to this list other than the Git commit messages - discussion should take place on `exim-dev`

## `exim-maintainers@exim.org`

This is a closed (invitation only) list for Exim maintainers, and those that package Exim for distribution only. It is very low volume.
