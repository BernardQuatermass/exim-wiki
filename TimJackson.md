[Tim Jackson](http://www.timj.co.uk) is a regular on the [exim-users
mailing list](EximMailingLists) and is the author of the [Spam and
Virus Scanning with Exim 4
HOWTO](http://www.timj.co.uk/linux/Exim-SpamAndVirusScanning.pdf), on
which topic he gave a talk at the 2004 UK Exim training course.

Tim is also the current maintainer of the [Exim
RPMS](ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/rpms-for-exim/)

Another pet project is Tim's [Bogus Virus
Warnings](http://www.timj.co.uk/linux/sa.php) ruleset for
[SpamAssassin](http://www.spamassassin.org/). This helps to stop the
collateral junk created by badly-configured virus scanners which bombard
faked senders with 'you sent us a virus!'-type messages.

There are various random tidbits of information about Exim on [Tim
Jackson's Exim Pages](http://www.timj.co.uk/linux/exim.php).
