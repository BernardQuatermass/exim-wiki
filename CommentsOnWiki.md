Comments On Wiki
================

There is a lot of information that we have that can be jammed into the
wiki. The real problem is organising things sensibly. I would really
appreciate comments added to this with ideas and opinions on how we
should organise things. For example how do we put the
[FrequentlyAskedQuestions](FrequentlyAskedQuestions) into the wiki -
it needs hierarchy because its pretty big, but how do we achieve that?

Some Suggestions
================

As for organising information on this Wiki, I suggest to apply the
following structure:

1.  Aim - Definition of the Aim/purpose/goal of this Wiki

2.  Introduction - Answering the questions: Why was this wiki created?
    Who setup this Wiki? What is the plan to achieve the goal? What is
    the current status? What are the next steps? How is the information
    on the Wiki Organised?

3.  System definition - Definition of the 'Exim' system, by describing
    the systems context / surrounding systems (mail servers, clients,
    agents).

4.  System functional description (Use cases) - Identification,
    definition, and description of exim's use cases and the related
    interactions between Exim and it's surrounding systems as mentioned
    above.

5.  System technical description (Use Case Realisations) - description
    of Exim's internal workings for the mentioned use cases.

6.  System non-functional description - Addresses all non-functional
    aspects of the system by identifying, defining and describing these
    aspects for exim.

7.  System deployment options - description of the different ways that
    exim can be used.

8.  System Environment - the operating systems that Exim supports.

9.  System Configuration

10. Exim FAQ

In essence, the FAQ is nothing less than an alternative view to the Exim
information in the wiki and contains pointers to documentation in the
other chapters.

By the way: I had entered more information, but I received an error
message and they got lost... -- [FreekDriesenaar](FreekDriesenaar)
