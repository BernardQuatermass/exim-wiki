Q0606
=====

Question
--------

I'm using tmail to do local deliveries, but when I turned on the
`use_crlf` option on the **pipe** transport (tmail prefers `\r\n`
terminations) message bodies started to vanish.

Answer
------

You need to unset the `mesage_prefix` option, or change it so that its
default `\n` terminator becomes `\r\n`. For example, the transport could
be:

    local_delivery_mbx:
    r = pipe
    nd = /usr/local/bin/tmail $local_part
    = exim
    nt_directory = /
      use_crlf
      message_prefix =

The reason for this is as follows: tmail uses the line terminator on the
first line it sees to determine whether lines are terminated by `\r\n`
or `\n`. If the latter, it moans to stderr and changes subsequent `\n`
terminators to `\r\n`. The default setting of the `message_prefix`
option is `From ...\n`, and this is unaffected by the `use_crlf` option.
If you don't change this, tmail sees the first line terminated by `\n`
and prepends `\r` to the `\n` terminator on all subsequent lines.
However, if `use_crlf` is set, Exim makes all other lines `\r\n`
terminated, leading to doubled `\r\r\n` lines and corrupt mbx mailboxes.
