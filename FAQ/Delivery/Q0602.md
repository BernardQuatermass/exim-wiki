Question
--------

Exim keeps crashing with segmentation errors (signal 11 or 139) during
delivery. This seems to happen when it is about to contact a remote host
or when a delivery is deferred.

Answer
------

This could be a problem with Exim's databases. Try running a delivery
with debugging turned on. If the last line of the debug output is
something like this:

    locked /var/spool/exim/db/retry.lockfile

the crash is happening inside the DBM library. Check that your DBM
library is correctly installed. In particular, if you have installed a
second DBM library onto a system that already had one, check that its
version of *ndbm.h* is being seen first. For example, if the new version
is in */usr/local/include*, check that there isn't another version in
*/usr/include*. If you are using Berkeley db, you can set

    USE_DB=yes

in your *Local/Makefile* to avoid using *ndbm.h* altogether. This is
particularly relevant for version 2 (or later) of Berkeley db, because
no *ndbm.h* file is distributed with it. Another thing you can try is to
run

    exim_dumpdb /var/spool/exim retry

to see if it also crashes, or build the *test\_dbfn* tool and fiddle
around with it. If both fail, it is most almost certainly a problem with
your DBM library. You could try to update it, or force Exim to use
another library. See the file *doc/dbm.discuss.txt* for hints about
this.
