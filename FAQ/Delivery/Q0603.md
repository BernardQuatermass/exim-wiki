Q0603
=====

Question
--------

How can mails that are being routed through routers that do not set
`check_local_user` be delivered under the uid of the recipient?

Answer
------

\`../Q0601\`\_ contains background information on this. If you are
using, say, an alias file to direct messages to specific mailboxes, you
can use the `user` option on either the router or the transport to set
the uid. What you put in the setting depends on how the required uid is
to be found. It could be looked up in a file or computed somehow from
the local part, for example.
