Question
--------

My */var/spool/mail* has grown drastically. Is there any possibility of
using two directories?

Answer
------

You can use an expansion string to split mailboxes between two
directories. For example,

    file = /var/spool/mail${nhash_2:$local_part}/$local_part

which does a hash on the local part, producing either 0 or 1, thereby
using (mail0) or *mail1*. But remember, the MUAs that read these
mailboxes also have to know where they are.
