Q0618
=====

Question
--------

I am trying to set exim up to have a automatic failover if it sees that
the system that it is sending all mail to is down.

Answer
------

Add to the **remote\_smtp** transport the following:

    fallback_hosts = failover.server.name(s)

If there are several names, they must be separated by colons.
