Q0620
=====

Question
--------

Why does Exim bounce messages without even attempting delivery, giving
the error *retry time not reached for any host after a long failure
period*?

Answer
------

This message means that all hosts to which the message could be sent
have been failing for so long that the end of the retry period
(typically 4 or 5 days) has been reached. In this situation, Exim still
computes a next time to retry, but any messages that arrive in the
meantime are bounced straight away. You can alter this behaviour by
unsetting the `delay_after_cutoff` option on the smtp transport. Then
Exim will try most messages for those hosts once before giving up.
