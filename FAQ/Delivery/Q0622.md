Question
--------

Can I write an ordinary file when I run a perl script as a transport
filter for the **remote\_smtp** and **address\_pipe** transports?

Answer
------

Yes, provided the file is writeable by the uid under which the transport runs (the Exim user in the case of the remote transport). However, if two messages are being delivered at once, their data will get mixed up in the file unless you implement your own locking scheme. If all you want to do is to take a copy of the message, another approach that avoids the locking problem is to use a system filter to set up an  unseen > delivery to a file. If you only want the message's headers, you can
> set `message_filter_file_transport` to point to a special
> **appendfile** transport that has `headers_only` set.
