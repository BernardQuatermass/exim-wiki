Question
--------

What does the error *User 1 set for local\_mbx\_delivery transport is on
the never\_users list* mean?

Answer
------

You have configured the **local\_mbx\_delivery** to run as the user whose id (uid) is 1. However, this user is on the list defined by the `never_users` runtime option, or the \<small\>FIXED\_NEVER\_USERS\</small\> compile-time option. These are  safety catch > lists; Exim refuses to deliver to any user that is on them. The most
> common use of `never_users` is to avoid doing any deliveries as
> *root*, but it can contain other uids.
