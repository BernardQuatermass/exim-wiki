Q0615
=====

Question
--------

When a message in the queue got to 12h old, Exim wrote *retry timeout
exceeded* and removed all messages in the queue to this host - even
recent messages. How I can avoid this behaviour? I only want to remove
messages that have exceeded the maximum retry time.

Answer
------

Exim's retrying is host-based rather than message-based. The philosophy
is that if a host has been down for a very long time, there is no point
in keeping messages hanging around. However, you might like to check out
`delay_after_cutoff` in the **smtp** transport. It doesn't do what you
want, but it might help.
