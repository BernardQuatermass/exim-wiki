Q0625
=====

Question
--------

I wish to have large emails go out one at a time.

Answer
------

One possibility is to set up a router that defers all large messages,
except in queue runs. Since queue runners deliver just one message at a
time, if you limited the number of simultaneous queue runners to 1, you
would get the effect you wanted. A suitable router might be

    defer_if_large_unless_queue_run:
      driver = redirect
      condition = ${if or{{queue_running}{<{$message_size}{200K}} }{no}{yes}}
      allow_defer
      data = :defer: too large for immediate delivery
      no_verify

Of course, this would always delay any large message until the next
queue runner, but if you run them fairly regularly, this shouldn't be a
huge problem, and may even be desirable. Note the use of `no_verify` to
ensure that this router is not used when Exim is verifying addresses.
