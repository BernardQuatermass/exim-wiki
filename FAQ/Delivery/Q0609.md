Q0609

Question
--------

Exim seems to be sending the same message twice, according to the log,
although there is a difference in capitalization of the local part of
the address.

Answer
------

That is correct. The RFCs are explicit in stating that capitalization
matters for local parts. For remote domains, Exim is not entitled to
assume case independence of local parts. I know, it is utterly silly,
and it causes a lot of grief, but that's what the rules say. Here is a
quote from RFC 2821: ... a command verb, an argument value other than a
mailbox local-part, and free form text MAY be encoded in upper case,
lower case, or any mixture of upper and lower case with no impact on its
meaning. This is NOT true of a mailbox local-part. The local-part of a
mailbox MUST BE treated as case sensitive. Therefore, SMTP
implementations MUST take care to preserve the case of mailbox
local-parts. Mailbox domains are not case sensitive. In particular, for
some hosts the user "smith" is different from the user "Smith". However,
exploiting the case sensitivity of mailbox local-parts impedes
interoperability and is discouraged.
