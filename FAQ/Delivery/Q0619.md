Question
--------

I can't get Exim to deliver over NFS. I get the error *fcntl() failed:
No locks available*, though the lock daemon is running on the NFS server
and other hosts are able to access it.

Answer
------

Check that you have *lockd* running on the NFS client. This is not
always running by default on some systems (Red Hat is believed to be one
such system).
