Question
--------

Can Exim add a *Content-Length:* header to messages it delivers?

Answer
------

You could include something like

    headers_remove = "content-length"
    headers_add = "Content-Length: $message_body_size"

to the **appendfile** transport. However, the use of *Content-Length:*
can cause several problems, and is not recommended unless you really
know what you are doing. There is a discussion of the problems in
[http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/content-length.html](http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/content-length.html).
