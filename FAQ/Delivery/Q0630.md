The reference manual contains an example that uses pipe delivery.

1.  Here is a transport that uses LMTP delivery, assuming that
    *\$local\_part* contains the username:

<!-- -->

    cyrus_inbox:
      driver =lmtp
      user = cyrus
      socket = /var/cyrus/socket/lmtp

1.  This is a transport that delivers direct to a non-inbox mailbox:

<!-- -->

    cyrus_mailbox:
      driver = pipe
      user = $local_part
      message_prefix =
      message_suffix =
      log_fail_output
      return_output
      command = "/usr/cyrus/bin/deliver -a $local_part \
                 -m <mailbox-name> $local_part"

This delivers to the Cyrus mailbox `user.$local_part.<mailbox-name>`.
Using `user = $local_part` and `-a $local_part` makes it work without
needing an explicit `p' ACL set for` anyone' on the mailbox.
