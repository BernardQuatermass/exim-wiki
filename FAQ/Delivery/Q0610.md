Q0610
=====

Question
--------

How can I force the next retry time for a host to be now?

Answer
------

You can change the retry time with the *exim\_fixdb* utility, but its
interface is very clumsy. If you have a message for the host on the
queue, the simplest thing to do is to force a delivery with the **-M**
command line option. If delivery succeeds, the retry data will get
cleared. If the host is past the cutoff time, so that messages are
bouncing immediately without trying a delivery, you can use **-odq** to
put a message on the queue without a delivery attempt, and then use
**-M** on it.
