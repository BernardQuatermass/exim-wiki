Q0633
=====

Question
--------

Why is *\$domain* not set in the **smtp** transport?

Answer
------

The **smtp** transport can handle several recipient addresses at once.
This happens by default if the host lists for the addresses are
identical. A single copy of the message is sent, using multiple
\<small\>RCPT\</small\> commands to transmit multiple envelope
recipients. The *\$domain* variable is set in the **smtp** transport
only if all the recipient addresses have the same domain. You must have
a case where several addresses with different domains resolve to the
same set of hosts. If you want to restrict the transport so that it
handles only a single domain at once (but still possibly with more than
one recipient), set

    multi_domain = false

If you want to restrict the transport so that it handles only a single
address at once, set

    max_rcpt = 1
