Q0604
=====

Question
--------

I want to use MMDF-style mailboxes. How can I get Exim to append the
ctrl-A characters that separate indvidual emails?

Answer
------

Set the `message_suffix` option in the **appendfile** transport. In
fact, for MMDF mailboxes you need a prefix as well as a suffix to get it
working right, so your transport should contain these settings:

    message_prefix = "\1\1\1\1\n"
    message_suffix = "\1\1\1\1\n"

Also, you need to change the `check_string` and `escape_string` settings so that the escaping happens for lines in the message that happen to begin with the MMDF prefix or suffix string, rather than .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

From.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> (the default):

    check_string  = "\1\1\1\1\n"
    escape_string = "\1\1\1\1 \n"

Adding a space to the line is sufficient to prevent it being taken as a
separator.
