Q0611
=====

Question
--------

I set up `|/bin/grep Subject|/usr/bin/smbclient -M <netbiosname>` as an
alias but it doesn't work.

Answer
------

That is a shell command line. Exim does not run pipe commands under a
shell by default (for added security - and it saves a process). You need
something like

    "|/bin/sh -c '/bin/grep Subject|/usr/bin/smbclient -M <netbiosname>'"
