Question
--------

If a user's mailbox is over quota, is there a way for me to set it up so
that the mail bounces to the sender and is not stored in the mail queue?

Answer
------

In the retry section of the configuration, put

    *@your.dom.ain        quota

That is, provide no retry timings for over quota errors. They will then
bounce immediately. Alternatively, you can set up retries for a short
time only, or use something like this:

    *@your.dom.ain        quota_7d
    *@your.dom.ain        quota       F,2h,15m; F,3d,1h

which bounces immediately if the user's mailbox hasn't been read for 7
days, but otherwise tries for up to 3 days after the first quota
failure.
