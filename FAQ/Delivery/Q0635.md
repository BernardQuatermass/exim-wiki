Q0635
=====

Question
--------

The log message *error ignored* appears after some delivery failures.
What does it mean?

Answer
------

This message is written when Exim fails to deliver a bounce message
whose age is greater than `ignore_bounce_errors_after`. It indicates
that the failing bounce message has been discarded. The same message is
written after failed deliveries when a filter file uses the `noerror`
feature when setting up a delivery, or if a router has the setting

    errors_to = <>

Both of these specify that delivery failures are to be discarded.
