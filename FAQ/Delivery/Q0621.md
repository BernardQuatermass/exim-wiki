Q0621
=====

Question
--------

My *.forward* file is `|/usr/bin/procmail -f-` and mail gets delivered,
but there was a bounce to the sender, sending him the output of
procmail. How can I prevent this?

Answer
------

Exim's default configuration is set up like this:

    address_pipe:
      driver = pipe
      return_output

The `return_output` option requests that any output that the pipe
produces be returned to the sender. That is the safest default. If you
don't want this, you can either remove the option altogether, or change
it to `return_fail_output`, to return output only if the command fails.
Note that this will affect all pipes that users run, not just your
procmail one. It might be better to arrange for procmail not to produce
any output when it succeeds.
