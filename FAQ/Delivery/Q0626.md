Q0626
=====

Question
--------

Exim can route local parts independent of their case, but the Cyrus LMTP
daemon requires the correct case. How can I fix this?

Answer
------

You need to rewrite the local part to the correct case before running
the router that routes to Cyrus. For example, if you require all lower
case, and your router is called `local_user`, put this router in front
of it:

    lowercase_local:
      driver = redirect
      redirect_router = local_user
      domains = +local_domains
      data = ${lc:$local_part}@$domain

The setting of `redirect_router` causes processing of the rewritten
address to start at the next router, instead of the first router. See
also \`../Q0630\`\_ and \`FAQ/Routing\_for\_local\_delivery/Q0414\`\_,
and see C045 for a more complete Cyrus configuration.
