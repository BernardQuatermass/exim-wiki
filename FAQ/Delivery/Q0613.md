Q0613
=====

Question
--------

I have set `fallback_hosts` on my **smtp** transport, but after the
error
[[sem@example.com](mailto:sem@example.com)](mailto:sem@example.com)
*cannot be resolved at this time* Exim isn't using them.

Answer
------

`fallback_hosts` works only if an attempt at delivery to the original
host(s) fails. In this case, Exim couldn't even resolve the domain
*example.com* to discover what the original hosts were, so it never got
as far as the transport. However, see
\`FAQ/Routing\_to\_remote\_hosts/Q0315\`\_ for a possible solution.
