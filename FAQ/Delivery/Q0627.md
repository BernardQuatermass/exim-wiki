Q0627
=====

Question
--------

Is there a command I can send to Exim to retry all queued messages
regardless of their retry schedule?

Answer
------

The **-qff** option starts a queue runner that forces a delivery attempt
for all messages, including frozen ones. If you use **-qf**, frozen
messages are skipped.
