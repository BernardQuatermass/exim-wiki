Q0631
=====

Question
--------

I would like to choose a retry rule based on on the sender rather than
the recipient address. Is this possible?

Answer
------

Yes. In release 4.43 and later releases, you can do this directly by
adding a third item to a retry rule of the form "senders=\<address
list\>". The retry timings themselves then become the fourth item. For
example:

    *   *   senders=:   F,1h,30m

would match all bounce messages. If the address list contains white
space, it must be enclosed in quotes. For example:

    a.domain  timeout  senders="x@b.dom : y@c.dom"  G,8h,10m,1.5

If you are using an earlier release of Exim, you can still achieve the
effect, but in a more complicated way. The address part of a retry rule
is matched as a single-item address list. Such lists are always
expanded, so you can use something like this:

    "${if eq{$sender_address}{xxx}{*@*}{no@no}}" quota F,1h,10m; ...

If the sender address is .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

xxx.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

, the pattern expands to .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

*@*.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

, which matches all recipient addresses; if you want to, you can make this a more restrictive pattern. If the sender address is not .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

xxx.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

, the pattern expands to .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

no@no.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

, which is assumed to be a recipient address that can never match, so
the retry rule is skipped.
