Q0617
=====

Question
--------

Exim seems to be trying to deliver a message every 10 minutes, though
the retry rules specify longer times after a while, because it is
writing a log entry every time, like this:

    1999-08-26 14:51:19 11IVsE-000MuP-00 == example@example.com T=smtp defer
    (-34): some host address lookups failed and retry time not reached for
    other hosts or connection limit reached

Answer
------

It is looking at the message every 10 minutes, but it isn't actually
trying to deliver. It's looking up *example.com* in the DNS and finding
this information:

    example.com.                MX 10 example-com.isp.example.com.
    example.com.                MX  0 mail.example.com.
    mail.example.com.           A  202.77.183.45
    A lookup for example-com.isp.example.com. yielded NXDOMAIN

The last line means that there is no address (A) record in the DNS for
*example-com.isp.example.com*. That accounts for *some host address
lookups failed*, but the retry time for *mail.example.com* hasn't been
reached, which accounts for *retry time not reached for other hosts*.
