Q0614
=====

Question
--------

After the holidays my ISP has always hundreds of e-mails waiting for me.
These are forced down Exim's throat in one go. Exim spawns a lot of
kids, but is there some limit to the number of processes it creates?

Answer
------

Unless you have changed `smtp_accept_queue_per_connection` it should
spawn only that many processes per connection (default 10). Your ISP may
be making many connections, of course. That is limited by
`smtp_accept_max`.
