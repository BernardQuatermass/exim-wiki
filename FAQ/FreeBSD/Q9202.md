Question
--------

A script that FreeBSD runs nightly uses *mailq* with the **-Ac**
parameter. Why doesn't Exim recognize this?

Answer
------

**-Ac** is a Sendmail option that requests that mailq  Show the mail submission queue specified in  /etc/mail/submit.cf *instead of the MTA queue specified in*
/etc/mail/sendmail.cf\*\*'. Exim doesn't have the concept of a .. raw::
html &\#147;

submission queue.. raw:: html &\#148;

. You can disable this feature of the nightly script by adding the line

::

daily\_status\_include\_submit\_mailq="NO" \# No separate 'submit' queue

to the file*\**/etc/periodic.conf*\**.
