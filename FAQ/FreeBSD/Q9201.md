Q9201
=====

Question
--------

On FreeBSD, */usr/sbin/sendmail* is a symbolic link to
*/usr/sbin/mailwrapper*; it doesn't contain the Sendmail binary. How
should I replace Sendmail with Exim on FreeBSD?

Answer
------

There is a file called */etc/mail/mailer.conf* which selects what to run
for various MTA calls. Instead of changing */usr/sbin/sendmail*, you
should edit this file instead, to read something like this:

    sendmail          /usr/exim/bin/exim
    send-mail         /usr/exim/bin/exim
    mailq             /usr/exim/bin/exim -bp
    newaliases        /usr/bin/true

You probably also need to edit */etc/periodic.conf*; see [Q9202](https://github.com/Exim/exim/wiki/Q9202)
