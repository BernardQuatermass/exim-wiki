Q0730
=====

Question
--------

How can I use the same passwords for SMTP authentication as I use for
Courier IMAP access to my server?

Answer
------

You can access the Courier authdaemon from an Exim authenticator. You
must arrange for the Exim user (often *exim* but sometimes *mail*) to be
able to access the authdaemon socket (e.g.
*/var/run/courier/authdaemon/socket* or
*/var/run/authdaemon.courier-imap/socket*). The configuration is
something of a hack, but it is reported to work.

    begin authenticators

    AUTHDAEMON_SOCKET = /path/to/authdaemon/socket

    # LOGIN authenticator
    login:
      driver = plaintext
      public_name = LOGIN
      server_prompts = Username:: : Password::
      server_condition = ${extract {address} {${readsocket{AUTHDAEMON_SOCKET} \
        {AUTH ${strlen:exim\nlogin\n$1\n$2\n}\nexim\nlogin\n$1\n$2\n} }} {yes} fail}
      server_set_id = $1

    # PLAIN authenticator
    plain:
      driver = plaintext
      public_name = PLAIN
      server_prompts = :
      server_condition = ${extract {address} {${readsocket{AUTHDAEMON_SOCKET} \
        {AUTH ${strlen:exim\nlogin\n$2\n$3\n}\nexim\nlogin\n$2\n$3\n} }} {yes} fail}
      server_set_id = $2

Don't set a macro AUTH in your configuration, otherwise this will not
work!

You can also use CRAM authenticators (CRAM-SHA1 is hardly used by any
mail client, but CRAM-MD5 is used by some). Note that you need at least
Exim 4.43 for that. Passwords in Courier's userdb are stored CRYPTed by
default, which cannot be used for CRAM, so you have to add the password
in addition:

    # userdbpw -hmac-md5 | userdb $user-login set hmac-md5pw
    (password dialog...)
    # makeuserdb

In Exim's main configuration:

    acl_smtp_auth = acl_check_auth

In the ACL section:

    acl_check_auth:
      accept set acl_c0 = <$pid.$tod_epoch@$primary_hostname>

In the authenticator section:

    # CRAM-MD5, RFC2195
    cram_md5:
      driver = plaintext
      public_name = CRAM-MD5
      server_prompts = $acl_c0
      server_set_id = ${sg {${extract {1}{ }{$1} }} {[^a-zA-Z0-9.-_]} {?}}
      server_condition = ${if eq \
        {${extract {address} \
          {${readsocket{AUTHDAEMON_SOCKET} \
            {AUTH ${strlen:exim\ncram-md5\n${str2b64:$acl_c0}\n${str2b64:$1}\n}\nexim\ncram-md5\n${str2b
    64:$acl_c0}\n${str2b64:$1}\n} \
          }} \
        {$value} fail}} \
        {${extract {1}{ }{$1} }} \
        {yes}}

Change every occurrence of "md5" to "sha1" to have a CRAM-SHA1
authenticator. Current builds of Courier also support CRAM-SHA256 (after
a security flaw was detected in SHA1, though it is more theoretically),
so you could even add CRAM-SHA256.
