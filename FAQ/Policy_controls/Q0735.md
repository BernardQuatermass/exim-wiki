Q0735

Question
--------

How can I block non-FQDNs in HELO/EHLOs?

Answer
------

Many workstation clients send single-component names; take care that you
do not block legitimate mail. With that proviso, you can do it using
something like this in an ACL:

    drop  message = HELO doesn't look like a hostname
       log_message = Not a hostname
       condition = ${if match{$sender_helo_name} \
    \N^[^.].*\.[^.]+$\N}{no}{yes}}

This means: Drop the HELO unless it contains a dot somewhere in the HELO
string, but the string may not begin or end with a dot. Thus, the
imposed minimum length is 3 characters. The data for HELO/EHLO doesn't
have to be a host name; it may legitimately be an IP address literal
instead. The above test succeeds with an IPv4 address literal, but if
you want also to accept IPv6 address literals, you will have to modify
the regular expression.
