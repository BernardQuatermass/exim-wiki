Question
--------

What should I put in my acl\_smtp\_rcpt?

Answer
------

Often, people want to arrange their RCPT ACL something like this:
-   Accept anything locally generated:

        accept hosts = :
-   Accept anything from authenticated users:

        accept authenticated = *
-   Accept anything from the local network:

        accept hosts = +local_network

    > -   here you have to decide what "local\_network" means - for
    >     example, you might want to define it as `192.168.0.0/16`
-   Reject non-local domains:

        deny domains = !+local_domains
             message = Relaying denied

    > -   this is what stops your Exim from being an open relay. Again,
    >     you have to decide what `local_domains` means.
-   Reject invalid recipients:

        require verify = recipient

    > -   this causes Exim to check that the recipient is *routeable*.

    >     `lktjnho@your.example.com` might not. Using

-   If you want to add extra checks (such as consulting DNS blacklists,
    or rejecting "bounce" messages with large numbers of recipients),
    this would be a good place to do add them.
-   Accept the rest:

        accept

But as long as you don't configure Exim to be an open relay, the details
are entirely up to you.
