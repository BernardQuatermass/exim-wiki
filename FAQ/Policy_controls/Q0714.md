Question
--------

Is there a way to configure Exim to reject mail to a certain local host?

Answer
------

No, only to certain domains. To reject at SMTP time, you can put a line
like this in your ACL:

    deny message = this domain is deliberately rejected
         domains = a.certain.domain

To fail addresses in messages that do not arrive over SMTP, you can set
up a router like this:

    reject_a_certain_domain:
      driver = redirect
      domains = a.certain.domain
      allow_fail
      data = :fail: this domain is deliberately rejected
