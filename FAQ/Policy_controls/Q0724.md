Q0724
=====

Question
--------

I have used `:fail:` in some aliases; when one of these addresses is refused, I see the message on the log, but the response to the remote user is .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

unknown user.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> instead of the message from the alias file. How can I change this?

Answer
------

Have you got a `message` qualifier in the relevant ACL? Exim uses the message line in the ACL in preference to the message returned by the router. This is so you can restrict the amount of information that .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

escapes.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;
