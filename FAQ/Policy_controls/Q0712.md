Question
--------

I've hacked sendmail to make an ioctl call at the time of the SMTP RCPT
command, to check if a user has exceeded their email quota. If they have
I issue a temporary failure and a message - can I do this with Exim?

Answer
------

If you can make this happen in Perl you can use the embedded Perl
facility, and use it from a `condition` condition in an ACL statement.
You can also use the expansion facility to run an external program, but
this uses more resources because it uses another process.
