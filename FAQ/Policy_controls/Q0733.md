Question
--------

Is there any way to tell Exim not to lookup the IP address against any
DNS black list if the connection is over IPv6?

Answer
------

Use this condition in your ACL:

    condition = ${if match{${mask:$sender_host_address/0}}\
                 {${mask:::0/0}}{no}{yes}}

From Exim 4.23 onwards, this can be simplified to

    condition = ${if isip6{$sender_host_address}{no}{yes}}
