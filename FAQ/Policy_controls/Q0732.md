Q0732
=====

Question
--------

I would like to either warn or deny when a host uses an underscore in
the EHLO command.

Answer
------

First, set

    helo_allow_chars = _

This tells Exim not to reject the EHLO or HELO command immediately. Once
you have done that, you can test for the underscore in an ACL. For
example, to log a warning for hosts in your LAN, and reject for other
hosts, you could do something like this:

    deny  message = Underscores are not valid in host names
          hosts = ! +lan_hosts
          condition = ${if match{$sender_helo_name}{_}{yes}{no}}

    warn  log_message = Accepted underscore from [$sender_host_address]
          condition = ${if match{$sender_helo_name}{_}{yes}{no}}
