Question
--------

How do MailScanner\_ and Exiscan compare? What are the pros and cons?

Answer
------

The big advantage of Exiscan is that it can reject messages at SMTP time
before you have accepted responsibility for them, which means you don't
have to deal with bouncing messages and thereby becoming a collateral
spammer. The big advantage of MailScanner\_ is that it gives you much
greater control over the load on your machines. You configure it
according to the maximum processing capacity of your computer and it
will not exceed that; in fact because it deals with messages in batches
the cost of processing a message actually goes down slightly as the load
increases, because the per-batch costs are shared by more messages. With
Exiscan, you have to rely on Exim's load protection mechanisms, which
basically means that you have to stop accepting messages when your
machine gets too loaded. This is bad if the machine happens to be an
SMTP smarthost. You therefore need more overcapacity with Exiscan than
with MailScanner\_.
