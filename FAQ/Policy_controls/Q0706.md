Question
--------

How can I get POP-auth-before-relay (aka POP-before-SMTP) support in
Exim?

Answer
------

A cleaner way of authentication is to use the SMTP AUTH facility, which does not require a prior use of POP. However, it is possible to do what you have asked for: Exim 4 supports the  whoson > ([http://whoson.sourceforge.net](http://whoson.sourceforge.net))

    require condition = \
      ${lookup whoson {$sender_host_address}{yes}{no}}

Otherwise you need to arrange for a list of permitted IP addresses to be
maintained in a file or database, and use this in a `hosts` condition in
an ACL statement. An Exim user has published this recipe:

Another Exim user submitted the following idea: Use a script to grab authenticated IP addresses from the log files of the POP3 and IMAP4 daemons. These are used to create files in the directory tree */var/db/popb4smtp*. The existence of a file represents a valid  popped recently token for the IP address used as the filename. Another script periodically removes stale files from the tree (after two hours). There's a small race condition here; it's possible for a file to be deleted just after it has been updated by the script that watches the logs. For low-volume servers, the odds of hitting this window are low. A POPB4SMTP\_CLIENT macro in the Exim configure file provides a reusable  has this sender popped recently? > query:

    POPB4SMTP_SUBDIR = /var/db/popb4smtp/${substr_-1_1:$sender_host_address}
    POPB4SMTP_CLIENT = ${if exists {POPB4SMTP_SUBDIR/$sender_host_address} \
        {$sender_host_address} {0} }

Now you can use it just about anywhere, including in your ACLs. Simple
examples include:

    hostlist relay_hosts = 127.0.0.1/32 : ... : POPB4SMTP_CLIENT
    host_lookup = !127.0.0.1/32 : ... : !POPB4SMTP_CLIENT
    rfc1413_hosts = !127.0.0.1/32 : ... : !POPB4SMTP_CLIENT

The two scripts (and a FreeBSD startup script for them) are available
