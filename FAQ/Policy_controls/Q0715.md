Question

How can I get Exim to remove attachments from messages?

Answer
------

Exim does not contain facilities for modifying messages. You must use an
external program if you want to do this. You can route messages that
have a *Content-type:* header line via a pipe to a command that does the
job and then re-submits the message to Exim. Alternatively, you could
use a transport filter to do this job.
