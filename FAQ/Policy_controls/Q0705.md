Question

How can I use tcpwrappers in conjunction with Exim?

Answer
------

Exim's own control facilities can do all that tcpwrappers can do.
However, if you are already using tcpwrappers for other things it might
be convenient to include Exim controls in the same place. First of all,
ensure that Exim is built to call the tcpwrappers library, by including
`USE_TCPWRAPPERS=yes` in *Local/Makefile*. You also need to ensure that
the header file *tcpd.h* is available at compile time, and the
*libwrap.a* library is available at link time, typically by including it
in `EXTRALIBS`. You may need to copy these two files from the
tcpwrappers build directory to, for example, */usr/local/include* and
*/usr/local/lib*, respectively. Then you could reference them by

    CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
    EXTRALIBS=-L/usr/local/lib -lwrap

in *Local/Makefile*. There are two ways to make use of the
functionality, depending on how you have tcpwrappers set up. If you have
it set up to use only one file, you ought to have something like:

    /etc/hosts.allow:

    exim : <client_list>  : <allow_or_deny>

For example:

    exim : LOCAL  192.168.0.  .friendly.domain  special.host : ALLOW
    exim : ALL                                               : DENY

This allows connections from local hosts (chiefly *localhost*), from the
subnet 192.168.0.0/24, from all hosts in **.friendly.domain*, and from a
specific host called*special.host\*. All other connections are denied.
If you have tcpwrappers set up to use two files, use the following:

    /etc/hosts.allow:

    exim    : <client_list>

    /etc/hosts.deny:

    exim    : <client_list>

Read the *hosts\_access* man page for more ways of specifying clients,
including ports, etc., and on logging connections.
