Question
--------

How can I configure Exim to delay the SMTP connection if more than 10
invalid recipients are received in one message?

Answer
------

Put something like this in your RCPT ACL:

    deny  message         = Max $rcpt_fail_count failed recipients allowed
          condition       = ${if >{$rcpt_fail_count}{10} {1}}
          ! verify        = recipient
          delay           = ${eval: $rcpt_fail_count * 10}s
          log_message     = $rcpt_fail_count failed recipient attempts

This example increases the delay for each failed recipient.
