Q0720
=====

Question
--------

I set `accept hosts=192.168.122.96/32` in order to accept mail for
relaying from my local LAN, but it doesn't work. What's wrong?

Answer
------

192.168.122.96/32 is not a network, it is a single host. Exim uses CIDR notation for specifying networks, where the number after the slash is the number of bits in the IP address that must match. Your setting says .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

32 bits must match.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

. If you really mean to specify .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

the next 32 IP addresses.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

, you need 192.168.122.96/27.
