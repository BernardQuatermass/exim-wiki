Question
--------

I set `accept hosts=192.168.122.96/32` in order to accept mail for
relaying from my local LAN, but it doesn't work. What's wrong?

Answer
------

192.168.122.96/32 is not a network, it is a single host. Exim uses CIDR notation for specifying networks, where the number after the slash is the number of bits in the IP address that must match. Your setting says _32 bits must match_. If you really mean to specify _the next 32 IP addresses_, you need 192.168.122.96/27.
