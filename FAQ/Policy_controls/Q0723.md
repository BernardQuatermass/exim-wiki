Q0723
=====

Question
--------

I can't get Pine to work with PLAIN authentication; Exim keeps
responding "535 Incorrect authentication data".

Answer
------

You need to have this setting in your PLAIN authenticator:

    server_prompts = :

This is missing in the examples in early Exim documentation, because it
was not realized that PLAIN authentication could be requested by a
client without sending the data with the request. If the data is not
sent, an empty prompt is expected.
