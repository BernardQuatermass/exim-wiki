Q0707
=====

Question
--------

I have one or two cases where my host correctly rejects messages, but
the remote host is quite persistent, and keeps trying over and over.

Answer
------

It is an unfortunate fact that a number of SMTP clients, in violation of
the SMTP RFC, do not treat a permanent error code that is given after
the DATA portion of the transaction as a permanent error. Consequently
they keep resending the message, and the worst offenders do so at very
short intervals. The only way to stop such behaviour is to blacklist the
IP address, or the envelope sender, or both, in such a way that future
messages get rejected at RCPT time instead of at DATA time. You could
also complain to the remote host's administrators.
