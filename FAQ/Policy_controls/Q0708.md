Question
--------

How can I run customized verification checks on incoming addresses?

Answer
------

There are a number of possibilities:

1.  If you can implement your checks in Perl, you can use Exim's ability
    for running an embedded Perl interpreter. For example, if you to run
    special checks on local addresses, you could use ACL statement like
    this:

<!-- -->

    require domains = my.local.domain
            condition = ${perl{verify}{$local_part}}

The result of the Perl function should be  yes or  no .

1.  You could also run an external program in a similar way, by a segment
    such as:

<!-- -->

    require domains = my.local.domain
            condition = ${run{/my/verifier $local_part}}

This requires the use of another process, so could prove more expensive
than Perl.

1.  If you are prepared to write C code, read the chapter in the manual
    titled *Adding a local scan function to Exim*.
