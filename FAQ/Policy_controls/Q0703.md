Q0703
=====

Question
--------

How can I test that my spam blocks are working?

Answer
------

The **-bh** option allows you to run a testing SMTP session as if from a
given IP address. For example,

    exim -bh 192.168.178.39

In addition to the normal SMTP replies, it outputs commentary about which tests have succeeded or failed. If you are not interested in the details, but just want to know if a particular sender at a particular IP address is able to mail to a particular recipient, you can use the `exim_checkaccess` utility, which provides a .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

packaged.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> version of **-bh**. You call it like this:

    exim_checkaccess 192.168.53.23 recip@my.domain -f sender@some.domain

If you don't give a sender, `<>` is used (that it, it acts like a bounce
message).
