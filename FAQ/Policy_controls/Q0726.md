Q0726
=====

Question
--------

My SMTP authentication can be bypassed by sending an unknown user name
and an empty password. What is wrong with this condition in a PLAIN
authenticator?

    server_condition = ${if eq{$2} {${lookup mysql{SELECT password FROM \
      accounts WHERE username='${local_part:$1}'} } }{1}{0}}

Answer
------

Your lookup item returns an empty string when the user does not exist.
You should instead arrange for the lookup to fail:

    server_condition = ${if eq{$2} {${lookup mysql{SELECT password FROM \
      accounts WHERE username='${local_part:$1}'}{$value}fail}}{1}{0}}
