Question
--------

I don't want to block spam entirely; how can I inspect each message
before deciding whether or not to deliver it?

Answer
------

Wherever possible, inspection and rejection is best done automatically in an ACL, that is, before the message is accepted. If you want to verify manually each message that is classified as spam by an automatic check, you can arrange for a system filter to freeze such messages after they have been accepted. If, after inspection, you decide not to deliver the message, it is safest to discard it, using the **-Mrm** option. Use of the **-Mg** option to force a bounce carries the risk of .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

collateral spam.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> if the sender address is faked (as it usually is in spam).
