Q0704
=====

Question
--------

How can I test that Exim is correctly configured to use a DNS black list
such as the Realtime Blackhole List (RBL)?

Answer
------

The **-bh** option allows you to run a testing SMTP session as if from a
given address. The *exim\_checkaccess* utility provides a more packaged
version of this facility. You need to know a blocked IP address with
which to test. Such a testing address is kindly provided by Russell
Nelson:

    linux.crynwr.com [192.203.178.39]

You can also send mail to
[[nelson@linux.crynwr.com](mailto:nelson@linux.crynwr.com)](mailto:nelson@linux.crynwr.com)
from the server whose RBL block you are testing. The robot that receives
that email will attempt to send a piece of test email in reply. If your
RBL block didn't work, you get a message to that effect. Regardless of
whether the RBL block succeeds or not, it emails you the results of the
SMTP conversation from a host that is not on the RBL, so you can see how
your server looks from the view of someone on the RBL.
