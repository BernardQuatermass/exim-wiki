Question
--------

Will Exim allow me to create a file of regexs and match incoming
external email to the list - and if a match is found file the offending
message into a special location? Also is it possible to make Exim only
filter parts of an incoming email - e.g. ignore large MIME attachments
for example and only process text/plain?

Answer
------

You can do some of this in a system filter. For example:

    if $message_body matches <...some complicated regex...> or
       $message_body matches <...some other regex...> or
       $header_from: matches <...regex...> or
       etc.
    then
      save /some/special/file
    endif

or instead of `save` you could have `deliver` (to some address) or
`pipe` (to some script). There isn't any mechanism for ignoring
attachments, but *\$message\_body* only looks at the first n bytes of
the body, where n defaults to 500 but can be changed. A more expensive
alternative would be to run a Perl subroutine using the embedded Perl
mechanism. If you passed over the message id, the Perl code could read
the message files on the spool and implement any algorithm it liked for
deciding what should be done.
