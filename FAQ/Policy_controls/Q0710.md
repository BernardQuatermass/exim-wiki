Question
--------

I want to reject certain sender-recipient combinations, with a specific
message for each such combination.

Answer
------

Set up a file (or database) containing the messages, keyed by the
combination, for example:

    sender1@sdomain1=>recipient1@rdomain1: blocked because...
    sender2@sdomain2=>recipient2@rdomain2: blocked because...

If you have lots of recipients for the same sender, it might be easier
to generate this file from more convenient data. In your ACL that is run
for each RCPT command, you can then put:

    deny message   = ${lookup{$sender_address=>$local_part@$domain}\
                     lsearch{/that/file}}
         condition = ${lookup{$sender_address=>$local_part@$domain}\
                     lsearch{/that/file}}{yes}{no}}

The condition is tested first. If the lookup succeeds, the condition
succeeds so access is denied. The message is then expanded, but the
lookup won't be repeated, because Exim will have cached the previous
result. This approach blocks only incoming SMTP messages. If you need to
do similar blocks for messages that do not arrive over SMTP, you have to
set up a suitable **redirect** router with a `:fail:` setting.
