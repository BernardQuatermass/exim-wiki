Q0717
=====

Question
--------

When using Nessus on a system that runs Exim, a number of security
issues are raised. Nessus complains that Exim answers to EXPN and/or
VRFY; sometimes it even complains that Exim allows relaying.

Answer
------

Exim supports EXPN and VRFY only if you permit it to do so in the ACLs
defined by `acl_smtp_expn` and `acl_smtp_vrfy`, respectively. Otherwise,
its responses are

    550 Administrative prohibition
    252 Administrative prohibition

Maybe the use of 252 is the .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

problem.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

. It is recommended that this be done (by those that discuss these
things) because there are stupid clients that attempt VRFY before
sending a message.
