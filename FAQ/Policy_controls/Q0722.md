Q0722
=====

Question
--------

I installed Amavis and it is working, but bounces are simply vanishing.

Answer
------

Check that you haven't inadvertently set up the transport like this:

    amavis:
      driver = pipe
      command = "/usr/sbin/amavis -f ${sender_address} -d ${pipe_addresses}"

The last line should be:

    command = /usr/sbin/amavis -f <$sender_address> -d $pipe_addresses

The important thing is the \<\> around the sender address; removal of
the unnecessary "" and {} is just tidying. See the amavis FAQ at
[http://www.amavis.org/amavis-faq.php3](http://www.amavis.org/amavis-faq.php3).
