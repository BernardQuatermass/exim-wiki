Question
--------

How can I arrange for each user to have a file listing the only sender
addresses from which she will accept mail? I want to do this so my
family members don't get any spam (or other inappropriate mail).

Answer
------

Let's assume each user has a file called *.acceptlist* in the home
directory. You can put in your ACL a line like this:

    require senders = /home/$local_part/.acceptlist

This will reject RCPT commands when the sender is not in the accept list
for the recipient. (Replace */home/\$local\_part* with whatever the
correct path to your user's home directories is.) One problem with this
is that it will block bounce messages, which have empty senders. You can
get round this, by changing the line to this:

    require senders =  : /home/$local_part/.acceptlist

However, this will, of course, let in spam that has a null sender.
