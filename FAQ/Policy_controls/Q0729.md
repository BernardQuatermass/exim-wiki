Q0729
=====

Question
--------

How can I screen out addresses that are neither valid usernames or
distribution lists on mail being forwarded to an internal Win2K server?

Answer
------

A user suggested using a router like this to do the recipient
verification:

    verify_user_router:
       driver = accept
       domains = win2kdomain.com
       local_parts=\
         ldap;user="cn=ldap-guest,cn=Users,dc=win2kdomain,dc=com"\
         pass=guest \
         ldap:://win2kpdc/dc=win2kdomain,dc=com?mailNickname?\
         sub?(&(mailNickname=$local_part)\
         (showInAddressBook=*)(sAMAccountName=*))
       verify_only

Set up ldap-guest as a normal domain user on the Win2K PDC. Also, you
need to set `no_verify` on all the other routers that handle that
domain.
