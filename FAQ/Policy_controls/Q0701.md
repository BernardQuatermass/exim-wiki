Q0701
=====

Question
--------

How do I block unwanted messages from outside my host?

Answer
------

Exim uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) for controlling incoming mail from
other hosts. A whole chapter in the reference manual is devoted to
describing how they work. A wide variety of conditions can be imposed on
incoming messages. The default Exim run time configuration contains an
example of an ACL which blocks all relaying, and messages whose senders
cannot be verified. This example is heavily commented and worth
studying.
