Q0513
=====

Question
--------

I want my system filter to freeze all mails greater than 500K in size,
but to exclude those to a specific domain. However, I don't seem to be
able to use *\$domain* in a system filter.

Answer
------

You cannot do this in a system filter, because a single message may have
multiple recipients, some in the special domain, and some not. That is
also the reason why *\$domain* is not set in a system filter. If you
want to take actions on a per-recipient basis, you have to do it in a
router. However, freezing is not appropriate, because freezing stops all
deliveries. You could, however, delay delivery to all but the special
domains by using something like this:

    delay_if_too_big:
      driver = redirect
      domains = !the.special.domain
      condition = ${if >{$message_size}{500K}{yes}{no}}
      allow_defer
      data = :defer: message too big.

However, there isn't an easy way of .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

releasing.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;
