Q0511

Question
--------

Whenever my system filter uses a `mail` command to send a message, I get
the error *User 0 set for address\_reply transport is on the
never\_users list*. What does this mean?

Answer
------

The system filter runs as *root* in Exim 4, unless you set `system_filter_user` to specify otherwise. When you set up a delivery direct from a system filter (an autoreply is a special kind of  delivery ) the transport runs as the same user, unless it has a `user` setting of
its own. Normally, deliveries are not allowed to run as *root* as a
security precaution; this is implemented by the `never_users` option
(see [Q0039](https://github.com/Exim/exim/wiki/Q0039)). The easiest solution is to add
this to your configuration:

    system_filter_user = exim

The system filter then runs as *exim* instead of *root*. Alternatively,
you can arrange for autoreplies from the system filter to use a special
transport of their own, and set the `user` option on that transport.
