Q0505
=====

Question
--------

My problem is that Exim replaces *\$local\_part* with an empty string in
the system filtering. What's wrong or what did I miss?

Answer
------

A message may have many recipients. The system filter is run just once
at the start of a delivery attempt. Consequently, it does not make sense
to set *\$local\_part*. Which recipient should it be set to? However,
you can access all the recipients from a system filter via the variable
called *\$recipients*.
