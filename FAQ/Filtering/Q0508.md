Question
--------

How can I allow the use of relative paths in users' filter files when
the directories concerned are not available from the password data?

Answer
------

You need to be running Exim 4.11 or later. You can then specify a value
for *\$home* by setting the router\_home\_directory option on the
**redirect** router. For earlier releases, there is no way to specify
the value of *\$home* for a **redirect** router; it either comes from
the password data as a result of `check_local_user`, or is unset.
