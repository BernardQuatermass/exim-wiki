Q0512
=====

Question
--------

I'm trying to reference the *Envelope-To:* header in my filter, but
*\$h\_envelope-to:* is always empty.

Answer
------

*Envelope-To:* is added at delivery time, by the transport. Therefore,
the header doesn't exist at filter time. In a user filter, the values
you probably want are in *\$original\_local\_part* and
*\$original\_domain*. In a system filter, the complete list of all
envelope recipients is in *\$recipients*.
