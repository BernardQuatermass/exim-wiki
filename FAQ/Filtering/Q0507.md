Question
--------

What are the main differences between using an Exim filter and using
*procmail*?

Answer
------

Exim filters and *procmail* provide different facilities. Exim filters run at routing time, before any deliveries are done. A filter is like a .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

&#148;

.forward *file with conditions*. One of the benefits is de-duplication.
Another is that if you forward, you are forwarding the original message.
However, this does mean that pipes etc. are not run at filtering time,
nor can you change the headers, because the message may have other
recipients and Exim keeps only a single set of headers. *procmail* runs
at delivery time. This is for one recipient only, and so it can change
headers, run pipes and check the results, etc. However, if it wants to
forward, it has to create a new message containing a copy of the
original message. It's your choice as to which of these you use. You can
of course use both.
