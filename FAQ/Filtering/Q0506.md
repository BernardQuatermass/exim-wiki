Q0506
=====

Question
--------

Using *\$recipients* in a system filter gives me another problem: how
can I do a string lookup if *\$recipients* is a list of addresses?

Answer
------

Check out the section of the filter specification called *Testing a list
of addresses*. If that doesn't help, you may have to resort to calling
an embedded Perl interpreter - but that is expensive.

In Exim 4.67 you will have a number of list processing expansion items
(`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forany` (condition), `forall` (condition),
and `addresses` to convert *\$recipients* to a list usable with the
previous) at your disposal.
