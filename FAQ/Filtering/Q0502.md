Question
--------

What I really need is the ability to obtain the result of a [reparación de cocinas madrid](http://www.madridreparaciones.com/cocinas) pipe command
so that I can filter externally and redirect internally. Is this
possible?

Answer
------

The result of a pipe command is not available to a filter, because Exim
does not run any actual deliveries while filtering. It just sets up
deliveries at this time. They all actually happen later. If you want to
run pipes and examine their results, you need to set up a single
delivery to a delivery agent such as *procmail* which provides this kind
of facility. An possible alternative is to use the `${run` expansion
item to run an external [reparación de hornos electricos madrid](http://www.madridreparaciones.com/hornos.html) command while filtering. In this case, you can
make use of some of the results of the command.
