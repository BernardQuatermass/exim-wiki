Question
--------

How can I set up a filter file to detect and block virus attachments?

Answer
------

Exim's filter facilities aren't powerful enough to do much more than
very crude testing. Most people that want virus checking are nowadays
using one of the separate scanning programs such as *exiscan* (see
[http://duncanthrax.net/exiscan/)](http://duncanthrax.net/exiscan/)).
There is some further information about scanning with Exim via
