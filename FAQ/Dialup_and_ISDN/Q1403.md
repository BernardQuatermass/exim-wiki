Question
--------

How should Exim be configured when it is acting as a temporary storage
system for a domain on a dial-up host?

Answer
------

Exim isn't really designed for this, but... The lowest-numbered MX
record for the domain should be pointing to the dial-up host. A higher
numbered MX record (lower priority) should point to the Exim server that
is acting as a temporary storage system. You should set a large retry
time for the domain, so that Exim doesn't keep trying to deliver when
the host is offline. When the host comes online, the waiting messages
have to be kicked somehow. This can be done by calling Exim with the
**-R** option, or via the SMTP ETRN command. This works provided the
number of messages is low. If you are handling lots of mail, keeping
messages waiting for their host to connect and those that are having
delivery problems to remote hosts all in the same queue doesn't work so
well. It is better in this case to get Exim to deliver the mail for the
dial-in hosts into some local files which then get transmitted by other
software when the host connects. One tool for doing this can be found at
[http://cr.yp.to/serialmail.html](http://cr.yp.to/serialmail.html). For
further discussion, see section entitled *Intermittently connected
hosts* in the manual, and also the section in the Exim book with the
same name.
