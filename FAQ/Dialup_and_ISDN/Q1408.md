Q1408
=====

Question
--------

If email has been deferred to a member on a local mailing list
(implemented through forward files), and one of our ETRN clients is on
this mailing list, the **-R** won't flush the mailing list message for
that client.

Answer
------

That is because **-R** matches only original recipient addresses, not
those produced as a result of expansion, because these are not (by
default) preserved from delivery to delivery. You can get round this by
setting `one_time` on the forwarding router, but you are not allowed to
have expansions to pipes or files on routers that have `one_time` set.
Therefore, you will have to have a separate router for mailing lists
(with `one_time` set) to the one used for normal forward files that
might specify pipe or file deliveries. However, the problem will still
be present for any user who sets up a *.forward* file to redirect to any
of the ETRN domains. See the last 3 paragraphs of \`../Q1407\`\_ for a
discussion of an alternative approach.
