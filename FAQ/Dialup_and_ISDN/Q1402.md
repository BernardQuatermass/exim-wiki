Q1402
=====

Question
--------

I have a dial-up machine, and I use the `queue_smtp_domains` option so
that remote mail only goes out when I do a queue run. However, any email
I send with an address
[[anything@aol.com](mailto:anything@aol.com)](mailto:anything@aol.com)
is returned within about 15 minutes saying *retry time exceeded*, and
all addresses are affected.

Answer
------

You should be using `queue_domains` rather than `queue_smtp_domains`.
With the latter, Exim is trying to route the addresses, which involves a
DNS lookup. This is presumably timing out, causing a retry time to be
set for the domain, and somehow a valid lookup never happened before the
maximum retry time (default of 4 days) passed. Hence the bounce. The
fact that it is *aol.com* is probably not relevant. You should probably
also be using **-qq** to do your queue run rather than **-q**.
