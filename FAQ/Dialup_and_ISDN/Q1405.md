Q1405
=====

Question
--------

I have an ISDN connection and would like a way of running the queue
automatically when it is up.

Answer
------

The following shell commands test for the interface being up and then
run the queue:

    ifconfig ppp0 | fgrep UP >/dev/null
    if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then exim -q ; fi

You could put these commands into a script which runs them at regular
intervals. You might want to use **-qq** instead of **-q**. With Linux,
the script */etc/ppp/ip-up* is run after a ISDN connection or a more
general PPP connection has been established. If you are using Linux, you
could put the call to Exim in that script.
