Q1409
=====

Question
--------

I would like to have a separate queue per domain for hosts which dial in
to collect their mail.

Answer
------

Exim isn't really designed for this kind of operation. The only way to
do this would be to cause it to send those messages to a differently
configured version of Exim with its own spool area. This could be done
via a pipe or SMTP to a private port. The main Exim, listening on port
25, would then be configured to run an appropriate command to prod one
of the others when it received ETRN, by means of the `smtp_etrn_command`
option. You could probably manage this with a single Exim binary and a
number of different configuration files, passed to the special versions
using the **-C** option. For this application they could all run as
*exim*, since no root privilege would be needed. An alternative approach
id to get Exim to deliver mail for such hosts in batch SMTP format into
some directory, and have the ETRN run something to pass such messages to
the dialled-in host. See also \`../Q1403\`\_.
