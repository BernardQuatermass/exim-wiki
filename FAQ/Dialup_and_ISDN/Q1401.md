Question
--------

When I'm not connected to the Internet, how can I arrange for mail to
other hosts on my local network to be delivered, while at the same time
mail to Internet hosts is queued without any delivery attempts?

Answer
------

Use the `queue_domains` option to control which domains are held on the
queue for later delivery. For example,

    queue_domains = ! *.localnet

allows delivery to domains ending in *.localnet*, while queueing all the
others.
