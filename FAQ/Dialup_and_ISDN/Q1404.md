Q1404
=====

Question
--------

I have `queue_domains` or `queue_smtp_domains` set, and use **-qf** to
force delivery of waiting mail when I dial in. How can I arrange for any
new messages that arrive while I'm connected to be delivered
immediately?

Answer
------

Instead of `queue_domains` or `queue_smtp_domains`, use the `queue_only_file` option. This causes messages to be queued if a particular file exists. If you put the word .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

smtp.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> before the file name, the queueing applies only to domains that are
> delivered by SMTP, thus not affecting local deliveries:

    queue_only_file = smtp/etc/present/when/not/connected

Then, in the scripts which are run when you connect and disconnect,
arrange to remove the file after connection, and create it just before
disconnection.
