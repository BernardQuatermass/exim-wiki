Question
--------

I'm trying to compile on an HP machine and I don't have *gcc* there. So
I put `CC=cc` in the *Local/Makefile*, but I got this error:

    (Bundled) cc: "buildconfig.c", line 54: error 1705: Function prototypes
      are an ANSI feature.

Answer
------

The bundled compiler is not an ANSI C compiler. You either have to get a
copy of *gcc* from the HPUX Software Porting Archives or buy the ANSI cc
from HP. The advice given by one user of HP systems on the Exim mailing
list was as follows: *Personally, I wouldn't use anything but the ANSI C
compiler. gcc works for compilation, but it doesn't know squat about
PA-RISC chips past the 1.0 rev. Since then, HP has come out with PA-RISC
1.1, 2.0, and 2.1, each with better features. gcc will compile for them,
but it doesn't produce anywhere near the optimization that HP's compiler
does.* *I took the gcc road when we moved from FreeBSD to HP-UX because
I was familiar with it. After 6 months, I had to go and re-port
everything over when we realized that gcc wasn't going to do it for us
long-term. If I could give advice to any new HP-UX admin: don't use gcc
if you can afford the ANSI C compiler. Based on the cost of even the
lowest HP workstation, that usually isn't a problem.*
