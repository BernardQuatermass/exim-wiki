Q5027
=====

Question
--------

Is there any way I can send bounces to the postmaster, and nobody else?
Basically, I want to receive them, and I don't want the reply/from
person to get them. If I think they need it I will forward it myself.

Answer
------

Put `errors_to=postmaster` on every router.
