Question
--------

How can I send a copy of all outgoing messages to another mailbox?

Answer
------

The most straightforward way is to set up a system filter, and include a
command such as:

    unseen deliver mailbox@whatever.domain

This sends a copy of every message to
[[mailbox@whatever.domain](mailto:mailbox@whatever.domain)](mailto:mailbox@whatever.domain)
(unless the message already has that recipient - Exim never does
duplicate deliveries). To save only *outgoing* messages, you need to
come up with a definition of what *outgoing* means. Typically, this
might be a check on the sender address and/or on the originating host.
Here is an example:

    if $sender_address_domain is mydomain.com and
       ${mask:$sender_host_address/24} is 192.168.124.0/24
    then
      unseen deliver mailbox@whatever.domain
    endif
