Question
--------

What precautions should I take when editing Exim's run time
configuration file?

Answer
------

Edit the file and save the result in a new file. Test the syntax of the
new file by running a command like this:

    exim -bV -C exim.conf.new

That will check for syntax errors without disturbing your running
configuration. If you are paranoid enough, run, as *root*,

    exim -C exim.conf.new <some address>
    <some message>
    .

and see if it delivers it. Carry on testing until happy. When happy,

    mv exim.conf.new exim.conf
    kill -HUP `cat /var/spool/exim/exim-daemon.pid`

Then check the Exim log to be sure the daemon restarted OK. Watch the
log for a bit to see that mail is flowing.
