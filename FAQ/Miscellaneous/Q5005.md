Q5005
=====

Question
--------

I used *gv* 3.5.8 (*ghostview*) to try printing *spec.ps*. After every printed page, the printer ejects a blank sheet. Is this something to do with using .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

letter.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> rather than A4 paper?

Answer
------

This seems to be an effect of using *ghostview*. Although the
PostScript\_ is generated for A4 pages, the size of the page images is
such that they should fit on a letter page (they are shorter than would
normally be used on A4 paper). If the PostScript\_ file is sent directly
to a PostScript\_ printer, there is no problem. An alternative is to get
hold of the *psutils* toolset, which is available from
[ftp://ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pub/psutils/psutils.tar.gz](ftp://ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pub/psutils/psutils.tar.gz).
It contains utilities for extracting pages (which can be useful for
double-sided printing) and for resizing pages. If you resize from A4 to
letter the text shrinks a bit, but should then be printable via
*ghostview*.
