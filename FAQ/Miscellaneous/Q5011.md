Q5011
=====

Question
--------

Is there a version of Exim available that runs under Windows?

Answer
------

A long time ago somebody took a copy of the Exim source with the aim of
trying to port it to Windows NT. However, I never heard anything more.
However, current versions of Exim can be made to run under Cygwin.
