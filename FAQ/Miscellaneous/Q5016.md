Question
--------

I've received a message which does not have my address in the *To:*
line. It is a spam message with the same address in both the *From:* and
the *To:* headers. How can this happen, and why doesn't Exim reject it?

Answer
------

There is an important distinction between the .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

envelope.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

from and to and the .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

header.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

from and to. The former are sometimes called the .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

sender.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

and .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

recipient.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

. An email message needs an .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

envelope.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

for the same reason that paper mail does - the envelope tells the delivery mechanism what to do with this copy of the message, whereas the *To:* header lists all the recipients, including those who have been sent different copies of the message because their mailbox is on some other host. An MTA such as Exim works entirely with the .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

envelope.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;
