Q5014
=====

Question
--------

Although I haven't set `check_spool_space`, Exim is still checking the
amount of space on the spool for incoming SMTP messages that use the
SIZE option. Can I suppress this?

Answer
------

The RFC for the SIZE option says: \*If the server currently lacks
sufficient resources to accept a message of the indicated size, but may
be able to accept the message at a later time, it responds with code ..
raw:: html &\#147;

452 insufficient system storage.. raw:: html &\#148;

.\* and that is what Exim is trying to implement. This is entirely
independent from `check_spool_space`, which says *don't accept any mail
if there is less than so much space in the spool partition*, though the
code is optimised to do both checks at the same time if required.
However, you can suppress the SIZE check if you want to, by unsetting
`smtp_check_spool_space`.
