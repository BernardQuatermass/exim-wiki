What does .. raw:: html

Answer
------

Originally, it was .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

EXperimental Internet Mailer.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

, which was the best I could come up with when I was starting out. At
that point it was experimental - I wanted to see if the ideas I had for
extending Smail's approach actually worked. Then somebody discovered
about it and wanted to start using it, and told other people about it...
