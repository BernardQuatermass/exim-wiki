Question
--------

How can I persuade Exim to accept ETRN commands without the leading \#
character?

Answer
------

Set the option

    smtp_etrn_command = /usr/lib/sendmail -R $domain

This causes Exim to run that command, with *\$domain* replaced by the
argument of ETRN. The default action of Exim is to require the \# sign
in order to be RFC-compliant, and to run the equivalent of

    smtp_etrn_command = /usr/lib/sendmail -R ${substr_1:$domain}

which uses the argument without the leading \# as the value for the
**-R** option. You aren't restricted to running Exim with the **-R**
option, of course. You can specify any command you like, with any number
of arguments. In particular, you can pass over the IP address of the
caller via *\$sender\_host\_address*. However, if you make use of
expansion strings in the arguments, each one must be entirely contained
in a single argument. For example, if you want to remove the first
character of the ETRN argument when it is @ or \#, you could use

    smtp_etrn_command = "/usr/lib/sendmail -R \
      \"${if match {$domain}{^[@#]}{${substr_1:$domain}}{$domain}}\""

The internal quotes are necessary because of the white space inside the
expansion string.
