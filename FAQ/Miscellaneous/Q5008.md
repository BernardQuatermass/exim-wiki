Q5008
=====

Question
--------

If I set up a domain list to contain **customer.com*, it
matches*customer.com\* and *abc.customer.com* as required, but it also
matches *noncustomer.com*, which is wrong. How can I get round this?

Answer
------

You have to specify two entries in the list:

    customer.com : *.customer.com

because \* in a domain list matches any characters, including `.` and
including a null sequence.
