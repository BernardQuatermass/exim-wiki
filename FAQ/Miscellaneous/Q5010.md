Q5010

Question
--------

I can't seem to find a pre-built version of Exim anywhere. The machine
is a Sparc 5 running Solaris 2.6.

Answer
------

The primary distribution is source-only. However, some people have built
and distributed RPMs and debs for Linux systems, and ports for FreeBSD.
I haven't heard of anyone doing this for Solaris. The main problem with
binary distributions is that there are a number of build-time options,
requiring the answers to questions like: . Which DBM library do you
have? (On Solaris probably ndbm, but no easy default on some other
systems.) . Which uid/gid do you want to use for Exim? . Where do you
want the configuration file to be? (Many different answers, even on the
same OS, depending on local policy.) . Ditto for the binaries. . Which
optional bits of Exim do you want to include?
