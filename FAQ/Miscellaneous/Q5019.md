Q5019
=====

Question
--------

I need an option that is the opposite of **-bpa**, that is, a listing of
those addresses generated from a top-level address that have not yet
been delivered.

Answer
------

Exim does not keep this information. It saves only the top-level
addresses and the list of addresses that are finished with. At each
delivery attempt, generated addresses are recomputed from scratch. This
makes it possible to correct errors in redirection data that is causing
delivery delays. However, there is an option you can set on a `redirect`
router that changes things. It is called `one_time`, and if it is set,
the list of generated addresses gets added to the top-level list at the
first delivery attempt, and is never regenerated. Because top-level
address lists must be real email addresses, this option cannot be used
if any of the generated addresses are pipes, files, or autoreplies.
