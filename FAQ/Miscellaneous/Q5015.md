Q5015
=====

Question
--------

I just noticed log entries that start off `<= <>`. Am I correct in assuming that the `<>` indicates that the envelope did not contain any  From > data?

Answer
------

Yes. This indicates a delivery failure report (aka a  bounce message ), as specified in RFC 2821. The reason for using empty sender addresses
is to identify bounce messages so that they themselves do not cause
further bounces. Empty senders are also used for other kinds of report
which should not themselves cause the generation of bounce messages. For
example, Exim uses them when sending out warnings about delivery delays.
