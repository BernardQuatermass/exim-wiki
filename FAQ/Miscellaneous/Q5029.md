Q5029
=====

Question
--------

A message with a recipient address that contains a non-printing
character is stuck on my mail queue. How can I remove this address?

Answer
------

You can use the **-Mmd** command line option to mark a recipient address .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

delivered.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

, which effectively removes it. If you are using the Bash shell, you can
enter non-printing characters using an escape sequence. For example:

    exim -Mmd 15HKvU-00013Q-00 $'\240'abc@x.y.z

In this example, the first character of the local part has a code value
of 240. If you are using a shell that does not support this, create the
command in a file and run it as a shell script.
