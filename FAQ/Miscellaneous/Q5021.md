Q5021
=====

Question
--------

Does Exim support POP and/or IMAP, or do I have to install something
else to do that?

Answer
------

Exim provides MTA functionality - that is, it delivers mail. POP and
IMAP are two of several ways of reading previously-delivered mail. Exim
does not provide that functionality. You need to install POP and/or IMAP
daemons; there are several to choose from, start looking here:
