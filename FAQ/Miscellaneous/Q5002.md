Question
--------

I want to .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

tail.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

the Exim log, but I have a number of other logs I also want to .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

tail.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

, and the number of tailing windows is getting to be a nuisance.

Answer
------

Look for a program called *xtail* (despite its name, it's not an
X-windows application). It allows you to do multiple tails, even of
entire directories. Alternately, get the GNU version of *tail*, from the
GNU textutils package
([ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/textutils/)](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/textutils/)).
GNU tail lets you run `"tail -f`" on multiple files at the same time,
although it doesn't work on entire directories like *xtail* can. If you
are running Linux, you probably already have a version of GNU *tail*
that can follow multiple files.
