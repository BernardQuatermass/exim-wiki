Q5034
=====

Question
--------

Is there any way to make the `queue_only` option conditional? I would
like the ability to queue messages from external sources while deliver
locally generated email as normal.

Answer
------

There is no direct way of doing this. However, you can achieve the
effect. In one of your ACLs that checks incoming mail from external
sources, put

    warn  control = queue_only

You can add other conditions as well, of course.
