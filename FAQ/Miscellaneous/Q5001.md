Q5001
=====

Question
--------

How can I arrange to allow a limited set of users to perform a limited
set of Exim administration functions? I don't want to put them all in
the *exim* group.

Answer
------

See [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/\~ian/userv/](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/userv/). Using *userv* you can arrange (for example) for certain users to be able to invoke *mailq* or *runq* or other preset commands as *exim* (or any other user, as configured) with only *userv* configuration. If you want to check the particular Exim options available you can easily do it with shell or Perl scripts and *userv* configuration, and provided you know how to do argument .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

unparsing.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> properly in shell or Perl it will be secure.
