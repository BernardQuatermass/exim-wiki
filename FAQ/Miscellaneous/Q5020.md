Question
--------

How can I make Exim receive incoming mail, queue it, but not attempt to
deliver it? I want to be in this state while moving some mailboxes.

Answer
------

Set `queue_only` in the Exim configuration. Then kill your daemon, and
restart it without the **-q** option (i.e. with just the **-bd**
option), so that it does not spawn any queue runners. This stops all
deliveries, remote as well as local.
