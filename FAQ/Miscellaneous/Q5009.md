Question
--------

I want to match all domains of the form **.oyoy.org* but want a few
exceptions. For instance I don't want*foo.oyoy.org\* or *bar.oyoy.org*
to be included. What is the best way to do this?

Answer
------

Use negative items in the domain list, like this:

    domainlist local_domains = !foo.oyoy.org : !bar.oyoy.org : *.oyoy.org

If there are many exceptions, you can use a lookup instead of listing
them all inline. If there are a number of exceptions that match a
particular pattern, you could use a regular expression.
