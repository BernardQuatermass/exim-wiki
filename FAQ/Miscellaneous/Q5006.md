Q5006
=====

Question
--------

Why aren't there any man pages for Exim? I don't always carry my printed
documentation.

Answer
------

A single man page that lists the command line options is provided in
file *doc/exim.8* in the Exim distribution. Several other forms of
online documentation are available. As well as plain ASCII text, the
there are two forms - Texinfo and HTML - which have a certain amount of
built-in indexing for ease of finding your way around. There are no man
pages apart from the command line one because the author of Exim hasn't
the time (or desire |:-)| to maintain yet another documentation format.
Besides, it is hard to know how to split the Exim manual up.
