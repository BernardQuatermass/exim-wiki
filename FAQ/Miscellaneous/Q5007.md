Question
--------

When I send a message using the **-t** command line option, Exim sends
only to the addresses within the message, not to those on the command
line.

Answer
------

There seems to be some confusion in the Sendmail community about the
interpretation of recipient addresses on the command line if the **-t**
option is used. Some versions do one thing, and some another. Here is an
except from one version of the Sendmail documentation for **-t**: *Read
message for recipients.* To:*,* Cc:*, and* Bcc: *lines will be scanned
for recipient addresses. The* Bcc: *line will be deleted before
transmission. Any addresses in the argument list will be suppressed,
that is, they will not receive copies even if listed in the message
header.* By default Exim follows this specification, and interprets
addresses on the command line as addresses not to send to. You can set

    extract_addresses_remove_arguments = false

to change this behaviour so that command line addresses are added to the
addresses that are taken from the header lines.
