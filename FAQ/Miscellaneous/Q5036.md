Q5036
=====

Question
--------

Can I make Exim stop accepting inbound emails when the queue gets above
some maximum number of emails?

Answer
------

There is no configuration setting which will do this, however you can do
this with a macro and an ACL stanza.

    # Global macro
    QUEUE_SIZE_MAX = 1000

    # Put in rcpt or predata ACL so sender and recipient are logged
    defer   set acl_c_queue_size = ${run {/usr/sbin/exim -bpc}}
            condition            = ${if gt{$acl_c_queue_size}{QUEUE_SIZE_MAX} {yes}{no}}
