Question
--------

I often have the problem that a message gets stuck in the mail queue and
I want it to be bounced to a certain address.

Answer
------

You can do this using a combination of four command line options, like
this:

    exim -Mf   14Fdlq-0003kM-00
    exim -Mmad 14Fdlq-0003kM-00
    exim -Mar  14Fdlq-0003kM-00  new@ddress
    exim -M    14Fdlq-0003kM-00

The first command freezes the message so that a queue runner won't start
to deliver it while you are changing things. The second command marks
all existing recipients as delivered. The third command adds a new
recipient, and the fourth command forces a delivery of the message,
which will cause it to be delivered to the new address, and then
deleted.
