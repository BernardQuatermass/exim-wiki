Q5035
=====

Question
--------

Does Exim run with different permissions between **-bt** and **-bh**, or
between verifying and actual sending?

Answer
------

Yes. For **-bt** it runs as root, as it would when delivering a message.
For **-bh**, **-bv**, and when actually receiving a message, it runs as
the Exim user.
