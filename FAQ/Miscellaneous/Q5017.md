Q5017
=====

Question
--------

Can (or will) Exim ever handle a message delivery purely in memory, that
is, it is handled without it ever hitting the disk?

Answer
------

It doesn't, and never will. Accepting and delivering a message are two
entirely separate, independent processes, which communicate only by
writing/reading the message on the disk.
