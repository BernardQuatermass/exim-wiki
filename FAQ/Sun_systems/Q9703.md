Question
--------

On SunOS 4 Exim crashes when looking up domains in the DNS that have
more than 10 A records.

Answer
------

There are Sun library patches to fix this. It is not Exim's problem. For
4.13\_U1 the patch is 101558-xx; for 4.1.3 the patch is 100891-xx. From
the README: *1054748 ftp, ping dump core when connecting to a host with
multiple DNS A records.* An alternative is to build another resolver
library - such as the ones that are part of the *bind* distribution -
and explicitly link against those.
