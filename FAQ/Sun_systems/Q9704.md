Q9704
=====

Question
--------

I am experiencing mailbox locking problems with Sun's *mailtool* used
over a network.

Answer
------

Under the `Expert` settings of *mailtool* is a option to turn on *Use
network aware mail file locking*. By default *dtmail* has this set, but
*mailtool* doesn't. You should set it. The help info on *dtmail* has
this to say about it: *Mailer tries to prevent two different instances
of itself from opening the same mail file at the same time through a
technique that detects this access when both instances of Mailer and the
file are all on the same machine. A network-aware mail file locking
protocol is available that uses* ToolTalk\_ *to coordinate instances of
Mailer running from more than one machine, or mail files accessed over
the network. Mailer can only change this option when first opening a
mail file.* If you are using the SunOS4 version of *mailtool*, this
apparently doesn't work. The only thing which does seem to work it
getting the user to hit the `done` button to make it release the lock.
