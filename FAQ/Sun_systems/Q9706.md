Q9706
=====

Question
--------

The *exiwhat* utility isn't working for me on a Solaris 2 system.

Answer
------

Have you got */usr/ucb* on your path? If so, it is probably picking up
the wrong version of the *ps* command. The *exiwhat* script is built on
Solaris to expect the normal Solaris version of *ps*.
