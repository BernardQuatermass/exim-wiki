Q9708
=====

Question
--------

I want Exim to use only the resolver (i.e. ignore */etc/hosts*), but
don't want to alter the *nsswitch.conf* file in Solaris 2.

Answer
------

You need to rebuild Exim after fiddling with *OS/os.h-SunOS5*:

    #define gethostbyaddr res_gethostbyaddr
    #define gethostbyname res_gethostbyname
    #define endhostent res_endhostent
    #define endnetent res_endnetent
    #define gethostent res_gethostent
    #define getnetbyaddr res_getnetbyaddr
    #define getnetbyname res_getnetbyname
    #define getnetent res_getnetent
    #define sethostent res_sethostent
    #define setnetent res_setnetent

Note that **-lnsl** is still needed in the Makefile as it contains code
used by the NIS lookup and also the *inet\_addr()* function that Exim
uses.
