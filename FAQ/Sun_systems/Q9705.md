Q9705
=====

Question
--------

Exim has been crashing on my Solaris x86 system, apparently while
running DBM functions.

Answer
------

The use of *ndbm* with *gcc* has caused problems on x86 Solaris systems.
Try changing one or the other; using either DB with gcc, or Sun's WS
compiler with *ndbm*, has fixed this in the past.
