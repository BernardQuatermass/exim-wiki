Q0203
=====

Question
--------

How can I arrange to do my own qualification of non-fully-qualified
domains, and then pass them on to the next router?

Answer
------

If you have some list of domains that you want to qualify, you can do
this using a redirect router. For example,

    qualify:
      driver = redirect
      domains = *.a.b
      data = ${quote:$local_part}@$domain.c.com

This adds `.c.com` to any domain that matches `*.a.b`. If you want to do
this in conjunction with a **dnslookup** router, the `widen_domains`
option of that router may be another way of achieving what you want.
