Q0204
=====

Question
--------

Every system has a `nobody` account under which httpd etc run. I would
like to know how to restrict mail which comes from that account to users
on that host only.

Answer
------

Set up a first router like this:

    fail_nobody:
       driver = redirect
       senders = nobody@your.domain
       domains = ! +local_domains
       allow_fail
       data = :fail: Nobody may not mail off-site

This assumes you have defined `+local_domains` as in the default
configuration.
