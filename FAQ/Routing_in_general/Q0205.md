Question
--------

How can I get Exim to deliver to me locally and everyone else at the
same domain via SMTP to the MX record specified host?

Answer
------

Create an **accept** router to pick off the one address and pass it to
an appropriate transport. Put this router before the one that does MX
routing:

    me:
      driver = accept
      domains = dom.com
      local_parts = me
      transport = local_delivery

In the transport you will have to specify the `user` option. An
alternative way of doing this is to add a condition to the router that
does MX lookups to make it skip your address. Subsequent routers can
then deliver your address locally. You'll need a condition like this:

    condition = \
      ${if and {{eq{$domain}{dom.com}}{eq{$local_part}{me{no}{yes}}}}}
