Q0207
=====

Question
--------

Why does Exim lower-case the local-part of a non-local domain when
routing?

Answer
------

Because `caseful_local_part` is not set (in the default configuration)
for the **dnslookup** router. This does not matter because the local
part takes no part in the routing, and the actual local part that is
sent out in the RCPT command is always the original local part.
