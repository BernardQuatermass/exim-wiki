Q0202
=====

Question
--------

Can I specify a list of domains to explicitly reject?

Answer
------

Set up a named domain list containing the domains in the first section
of the configuration, for example:

    domainlist reject_domains = list:of:domains:to:reject

You can use this list in an ACL to reject any SMTP recipients in those
domains. You can also give a customized error message, like this:

    deny message = The domain $domain is no longer supported
         domains = +reject_domains

If you also want to reject these domains in messages that are submitted
from the command line (not using SMTP), you need to set up a router to
do it, like this:

    reject_domains:
      driver = redirect
      domains = +reject_domains
      allow_fail
      data = :fail: The domain $domain is no longer supported
