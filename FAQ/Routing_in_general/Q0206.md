Q0206
=====

Question
--------

How can I get Exim to deliver certain domains to a different SMTP port
on my local host?

Answer
------

You must set up a special **smtp** transport, where you can specify the
`port` option, and then set up a router to route the domains to that
transport. There are two possibilities for specifying the host:

1.  If you use a **manualroute** router, you can specify the local host
    in the router options. You must also set

<!-- -->

    self = send

so that it does not object to sending to the local host.

1.  If you use a router that cannot specify hosts (for example, an
    **accept** router with appropriate conditions), you have to specify
    the host using the `hosts` option of the transport. In this case,
    you must also set `allow_localhost` on the transport.
