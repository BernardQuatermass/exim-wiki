Question
--------

Exim is complaining about an invalid command line when Majordomo tries
to send it a message for delivery.

Answer
------

Take a look at your *majordomo.cf* file, It should have something that
looks like

    $sendmail_command = "/usr/lib/sendmail";

and another line like

    $mailer = "$sendmail_command -oi -oee -f\$sender";

If you have modified *resend* (one of the majordomo programs) to use
*\$sendmail\_command* instead of *\$mailer* you will be calling Exim
with no command line arguments.
