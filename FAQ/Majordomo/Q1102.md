Q1102
=====

Question
--------

I have set *\$mailer* in *majordomo.cf*, but it still isn't setting the
sender correctly in the messages it sends.

Answer
------

Make sure you have got the quoting correct in the *\$mailer* setting.
For example,

    $mailer = "$sendmail_command -oi -oee -f$sender\@lists.mydomain.de";

is not correct. It needs three backslashes, not one, and the \$ at the
start of *\$sender* has to be escaped with a backslash.
