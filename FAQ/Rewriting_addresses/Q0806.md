Question
--------

I'm using *\$domain* as the key for a lookup in a rewriting rule, but
its contents are not being lowercased. Aren't domains supposed to be
handled caselessly?

Answer
------

The value of *\$domain* is the actual domain that appears in the
address. It could of course be lower cased, but I know that would cause
some unhappiness, because some people have mixed-case domain names which
look silly if the case is changed. Thus, one wants to preserve the case
in rewrites such as

    *@*.TheRap.com   something@$domain

because .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

therap.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;
