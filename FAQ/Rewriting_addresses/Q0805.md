Question
--------

Is it possible to completely fail a message if the rewrite rules fail?

Answer
------

It depends on what you mean by .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

fail a message.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> and what addresses you are rewriting. If you are rewriting recipient
> addresses for your local domain, you can do:

    *@dom.ain  ${lookup{$1}dbm{/wher/ever}{$value}{failaddr}}  Ehq

and in your alias file put something like

    failaddr:   :fail: Rewriting failed

This fails a single recipient - others are processed independently.
