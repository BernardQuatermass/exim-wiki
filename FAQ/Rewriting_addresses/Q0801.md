Question

How can I get Exim to strip the hostname from the sender's address?

Answer
------

If you set up a rewriting rule in the following form:

    *@*.your.domain  $1@your.domain

then Exim will rewrite all addresses in the envelope and the headers,
removing anything between `@` and `your.domain`. This applies to all
messages that Exim processes. If you want to rewrite sender addresses
only, the the rule should be

    *@*.your.domain  $1@your.domain  Ffrs

This applies the rule only to the envelope sender address and to the
*From:*, *Reply-to:*, and *Sender:* headers.

The same rules can also be used if you want to ensure that the envelope
sender is always set to the From: address. This is highly useful on a
web hosting server where most people just install whatever programs they
find and they don't use the -f or Return-path: headers to set the
envelope sender. When they do this and a bounce occurs, the webmaster
doesn't get the bounce mail, so they don't know that there is a problem.
To fix this use:

    *@*.your.domain  ${sg{$h_from:}{^.*<(.*)>}{\$1}}  Ffrs

This causes
[[user@host.domain.com](mailto:user@host.domain.com)](mailto:user@host.domain.com)
to be replaced with their From: header. And if they've entered a full
From address, then it will strip the e-mail from "User name"
\<user@domain\>. This helps in tracking down the mail a lot, and makes
sure that customer's get their bounces.
