Q0807
=====

Question
--------

I want to rewrite local sender addresses depending on the domain of the
recipient.

Answer
------

In general, this is not possible, because a message may have more than
one recipient and Exim keeps just a single copy of each message. It may
also deliver one copy of a message with several recipient addresses. You
can do an incomplete job by using a regular expression match in a
rewrite rule to test, for example, the contents of the *To:* header.
This would work except in cases of multiple recipients.
