Q0804

Question
--------

I'm using this rewriting rule to change login names into _friendly_ names, but if mail comes in for an upper case login name, it doesn't get rewritten.

    *@my.domain      ${lookup{$1}dbm{/usr/lib/exim/longforms}\
    $value}fail}@my.domain bcfrtFT

The longforms database has entries of the form:

    ano23: A.N.Other

Answer
------

Replace `$1` in your rule by `${lc:$1}` to force the local part to lower
case before it is used as a lookup key.
