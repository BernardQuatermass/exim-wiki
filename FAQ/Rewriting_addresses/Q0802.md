Q0802
=====

Question
--------

I have Exim configured to remove the hostname portion of the domain on
outgoing mail, and yet the hostname is present when the mail gets
delivered.

Answer
------

Check the DNS record for your domain. If the MX record points to a CNAME record instead of to an A record, some MTAs (not Exim) are liable to rewrite addresses, changing your domain name to its _canonical_ form, as obtained from the CNAME record.
