Q1703
=====

Question
--------

I have some legacy clients that don't use STARTTLS, but which expect to
negotiate a TLS session automatically on connection to the ssmtp port
(465). Can Exim handle this?

Answer
------

If you are using release 4.43 or later, you can set

    tls_on_connect_ports = 465

and then arrange for your daemon to listen on both port 25 and port 465
by setting `daemon_smtp_ports` or `local_interfaces` or the **-X**
command line option. Or use *inetd* to listen on port 465. If you are
using an earlier release of Exim, you need to run two Exim listeners, on
different ports, one of which is started with the **-tls-on-connect**
option (which makes all ports act this way). You can either use two
daemons, or a single daemon, with the other listener using *inetd*. For
example, here are commands to start two daemons:

    exim -bd -q15m
    exim -bd -oX '[0.0.0.0]::465' -tls-on-connect

The first is a .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

normal.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> daemon; the second listens on port 465 and expects to negotiate a TLS
> session at the start of each connection.
