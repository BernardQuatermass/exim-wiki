Question
--------

I am trying to set up an Exim server that uses a self-signed certificate
to enable my clients to use TLS. However, clients other than Exim refuse
to accept this certificate. What's wrong?

Answer
------

It seems that some clients require that the certificate presented by the server be a user (also called .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

leaf.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

or .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

site.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

) certificate, and not a self-signed certificate. In this situation, the
self-signed certificate must be installed on the client as a trusted
root *certification authority* (CA), and the certificate used by the
server must be a user certificate signed with that self-signed
certificate. For information on creating self-signed CA certificates and
using them to sign user certificates, see the *General implementation
overview* chapter of the Open-source PKI book, available online at
[http://ospkibook.sourceforge.net/](http://ospkibook.sourceforge.net/).
Here is a quick overview. First, read this message:
[http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/mid.cgi?id=3C3F3A93.C1ECF9B0%40mindspring.com](http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/mid.cgi?id=3C3F3A93.C1ECF9B0%40mindspring.com)
Then, follow the instructions found on these two (consecutive) pages:
[http://ospkibook.sourceforge.net/docs/OSPKI-2.4.6/OSPKI/initialisation.htm](http://ospkibook.sourceforge.net/docs/OSPKI-2.4.6/OSPKI/initialisation.htm)
[http://ospkibook.sourceforge.net/docs/OSPKI-2.4.6/OSPKI/keygensign.htm](http://ospkibook.sourceforge.net/docs/OSPKI-2.4.6/OSPKI/keygensign.htm)
Two points on the PKI Book literature:

1.  It's assumed that it's okay to use a passphrase-protected key to
    encrypt the user/site/leaf certificate. If this isn't acceptable,
    you seem to be able to strip out the passphrase as follows:

<!-- -->

    openssl rsa -in user.key -our user.key.new
    user.key.new

This should be done immediately after *user.key* is created.

1.  The *sign.sh* script is available in the *mod\_ssl* distribution,
    available at
    [http://www.modssl.org/source/](http://www.modssl.org/source/).

Having followed the instructions, you end up with the following files:
(a) *ca.crt* This file should be installed into the client software as a
trusted root certification authority. In Windows XP, this can be done as
follows:

> Call the file *ca\_cert.cer* br\_ Double-click on the file br\_
> "Install Certificate"; br\_ "Next" br\_ "Place all certificates in the
> following store" br\_ "Browse..." br\_ "Trusted Root Certification
> Authorities" br\_ "OK" br\_ "Next" br\_ "Finish" br\_ "Yes" br\_ "OK"

(b) *user.crt* and *user.key* These files should be installed into the
    server software. In Exim, this can be done by adding these lines to
    the configuration file:

<!-- -->

    tls_certificate = /usr/local/etc/exim/tls_cert
    tls_privatekey = /usr/local/etc/exim/tls_key

Then install *user.crt* and *user.key* under the names *tls\_cert* and
*tls\_key* in the appropriate directory.
