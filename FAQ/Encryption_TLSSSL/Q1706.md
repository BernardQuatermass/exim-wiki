Q1706
=====

Question
--------

I have listed some hosts in `tls_verify_hosts` and provided them with
certificates, but their connections are always rejected.

Answer
------

Make sure that the server file containing the expected certificates
(defined by `tls_verify_certificates`) is readable by the Exim user. See
also the answer to \`../Q1705\`\_.
