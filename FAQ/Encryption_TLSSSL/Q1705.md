Q1705
=====

Question
--------

I have listed some hosts in `tls_try_verify_hosts`, but when they
connect, no data appears in *\$tls\_peerdn*.

Answer
------

This means that the clients have not sent certificates when asked by the
server to do so. If the clients are running Exim, check that
`tls_certificate` is correctly set in their **smtp** transports. Note
that this value is not automatically inherited from the global
`tls_certificate` option.
