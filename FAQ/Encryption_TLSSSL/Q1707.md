Q1707
=====

Question
--------

I am trying to use TLS with Evolution as a client, and keep seeing this
error: *SMTP protocol violation: synchronization error (next input sent
too soon): rejected "200F*:superscript:\`A\`*C".* What does it mean?

Answer
------

See \`FAQ/General\_Debugging/Q0086\`\_ for a general explanation of the
error. In this case, it probably means that Evolution is trying to
negotiate a TLS session immediately it connects, without first using the
STARTTLS command. This was an older way of starting up TLS, before
STARTTLS was defined. See \`../Q1703\`\_ for how to deal with this.
