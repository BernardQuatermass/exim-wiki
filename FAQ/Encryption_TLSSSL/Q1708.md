Q1708
=====

Question
--------

I trying to use TLS with Outlook as a client on a box that is running
Norton Antivirus, but all my email is being rejected with *Unsupported
command* errors. Why?

Answer
------

Norton Antivirus does not support TLS or AUTH. It puts a broken SMTP
proxy between you and the Exim server. You need to turn off outbound
scanning of email.
