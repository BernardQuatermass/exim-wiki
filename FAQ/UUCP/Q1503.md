Question
--------

We see something strange on our system in regards to mail coming in via
rmail from a UUCP link. The sender is being set to mailmaster instead of
the real sender, and a *Sender:* header is being added to the message.

Answer
------

If *mailmaster* is the user that is running rmail, you need to include
that user in the `trusted_users` configuration option. Only trusted
users are permitted to specify senders when mail is passed to Exim via
the command line.
