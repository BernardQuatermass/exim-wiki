Question
--------

The MX records for some UUCP domains point to my local host. How do I
get it to pass the messages on to UUCP?

Answer
------

The simplest way is to create a file containing a list of domains, and
the hosts to which their messages should be sent, like this:

    uucp1.domain.example:   uucp1.host.example
    uucp2.domain.example:   uucp2.host.example
    ....

Then you can use a router like this:

    uucp_router:
      driver = accept
      domains = lsearch;/etc/uucp/domains
      transport = uucp_transport

and a transport like this:

    uucp_transport:
      driver = pipe
      user = nobody
      command = /usr/local/bin/uux - -r $domain_data!rmail $local_part
      return_fail_output

The *\$domain\_data* variable retains the value that is looked up when
the `domains` option in the router is matched.
