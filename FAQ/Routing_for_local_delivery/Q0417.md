Question
--------

What do I need to do to make Exim handle */usr/ucb/vacation* processing
automatically, so that people could just create a *.vacation.msg* file
in their home directory and not have to edit their *.forward* file?

Answer
------

Add a new router like this, immediately before the normal **localuser**
router:

    vacation:
      driver = accept
      check_local_user
      require_files = $home/.vacation.msg
      transport = vacation_transport
      unseen

and a matching new transport like this:

    vacation_transport:
      driver = pipe
      command = /usr/ucb/vacation $local_part

However, some versions of */usr/ucb/vacation* do not work properly
unless the DBM file(s) it uses are created in advance - it won't create
them itself. You also need a way of removing them when the vacation is
over. Another possibility is to use a fixed filter file which is run
whenever *.vacation.msg* exists, for example:

    vacation:
      driver = redirect
      check_local_user
      require_files = $home/.vacation.msg
      file = /some/central/filter
      allow_filter

The filter file should use the `if personal` check before sending mail, to avoid generating automatic responses to mailing lists. If sending a message is all that it does, this doesn't count as a _significant_ delivery, so the original message goes on to be delivered as normal.

Yet another possibility is to make use of Exim's **autoreply** transport, and not use */usr/ucb/vacation* at all.
