Q0416

Question
--------

What is quickest way to set up Exim so any message sent to a
non-existing user would bounce back with a different message, based on
the name of non-existing user?

Answer
------

Place this router last, so that it catches any local addresses that are
not otherwise handled:

    non_exist:
      driver = accept
      transport = non_exist_reply
      no_verify

Then add the following transport to the transports section:

    non_exist_reply:
      driver = autoreply
      user = exim
      to = $sender_address
      subject = User does not exist
      text = You sent mail to $local_part. That's not a valid user here. \
             The subject was: $subject.

If you want to pick up a message from a file, you can use the `file`
option (use `file_expand` if you want its contents expanded).
