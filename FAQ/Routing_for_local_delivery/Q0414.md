Q0414
=====

Question
--------

I have set `caseful_local_part` on the routers that handle my local
domain because my users have upper case letters in their login names,
but incoming mail now has to use the correct case. Can I relax this
somehow?

Answer
------

If you really have to live with caseful user names but want incoming
local parts to be caseless, then you have to maintain a file, indexed by
the lower case forms, that gives the correct case for each login, like
this:

    admin:    Admin
    steven:   Steven
    mcdonald: McDonald
    lamanch:  LaManche
    ...

and at the start of the routers that handle your local domain, put one
like this:

    set_case_router:
      driver = redirect
      data = ${lookup{${lc:$local_part}}lsearch{/the/file}}
      qualify_preserve_domain

For efficiency, you should also set the `redirect_router` option to
cause processing of the changed address to begin at the next router. If
you are otherwise using the default configuration, the setting would be

    redirect_router = system_aliases

If there are lots of users, then a DBM or cdb file would be more
efficient than a linear search. If you are handling several domains, you
will have to extend this configuration to cope appropriately.
