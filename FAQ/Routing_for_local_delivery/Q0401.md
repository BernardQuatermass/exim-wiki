Q0401
=====

Question
--------

I need to have any mail for *virt.dom.ain* that doesn't match one of the
aliases in */usr/lib/aliases.virt* delivered to a particular address,
for example,
[[postmaster@virt.dom.ain](mailto:postmaster@virt.dom.ain)](mailto:postmaster@virt.dom.ain).

Answer
------

Adding an asterisk to a search type causes Exim to look up .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

\*.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> when the normal lookup fails. So if your aliasing router is something
> like this:

    virtual:
      driver = redirect
      domains = virt.dom.ain
      data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/usr/lib/aliases.virt}}
      no_more

you should change `lsearch` to `lsearch*`, and put this in the alias
file:

    *: postmaster@virt.dom.ain

This solution has the feature that if there are several unknown
addresses in the same message, only one copy gets sent to the
postmaster, because of Exim's normal de-duplication rules. NOTE: This
solution works only if there is also an entry for *postmaster* in the
alias file, ultimately resolving to an address that is not in
*virt.dom.ain*.
