Question
--------

I want mail for any local part at certain virtual domains to go to a
single address for each domain.

Answer
------

One way to do this is to insert the following code into you exim4
configuration file. For example, under debian this file might be called
exim4.conf.template, (depending on your configuration.) Insert the code
into the routing section in the configuration file.

    virtual:
      driver = redirect
      data = ${lookup{$domain}lsearch{/etc/virtual}}

You may have to create the */etc/virtual* file yourself, then make sure
it contains a list of domains and the addresses to which their mail
should be sent. For example:

    domain1:  postmaster@some.where.else
    domain2:  joe@xyz.plc

If the number of domains is large, using a DBM or cdb file would be more
efficient. If the lookup fails to find the domain in the file, the value
of the `data` option is empty, causing the router to decline.
