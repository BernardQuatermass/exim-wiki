Q0426
=====

Question
--------

One of the things I want to set up is for *anything@onedomain* to
forward to *anything@anotherdomain*. I tried adding
*\$local\_part@anotherdomain* to my aliases but it did not expand - it
sent it to that literal address.

Answer
------

If you want to do it that way, you can use the `expand` operator on the
lookup used in the data option of the redirect router. For example:

    data = ${expand:${lookup{$local_part}lsearch*{/etc/aliases}}}

Another approach is to use a router like this:

    forwarddomain:
      driver = redirect
      domains = onedomain
      data = $local_part@anotherdomain

The value of `data` can, of course, be more complicated, involving
lookups etc. if you have lots of different cases.
