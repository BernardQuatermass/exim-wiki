Q0428
=====

Question
--------

I've converted from Sendmail, and I notice that Exim doesn't make use of
the `owner-` entries in my alias file to change the sender address in
outgoing messages to a mailing list.

Answer
------

If you have an alias file with entries like this:

    somelist:        a@b, c@d, ...
    owner-somelist:  postmaster

Sendmail assumes that the second entry specifies a new sender address
for the first. Exim does not make this assumption. However, you can make
it take the same action, by adding

    errors_to = owner-$local_part@whatever.domain

to the configuration for your aliasing router. This is fail-safe,
because Exim verifies a new sender address before using it. Thus, the
change of sender address occurs only when the owner entry exists.
