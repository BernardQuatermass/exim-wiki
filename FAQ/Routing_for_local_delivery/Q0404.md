Q0404
=====

Question
--------

How can I arrange for messages submitted by (for example) Majordomo to
be handled specially?

Answer
------

You can use the `condition` option on a router, with a setting such as

    condition = ${if and {{eq {$sender_host_address}{}} \
                {eq {$sender_ident}{majordom

> {yes}{no}}}}} This first tests for a locally-submitted message, by
> ensuring there is no sending host address, and then it checks the
> identity of the user that ran the submitting process.
