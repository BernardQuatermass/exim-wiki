Q0418
=====

Question
--------

I want to use a default entry in my alias file to handle unknown local
parts, but it picks up the local parts that the aliases generate. For
example, if the alias file is

    luke.skywalker: luke
    ls: luke
    *: postmaster

then messages addressed to *luke.skywalker* end up at *postmaster*.

Answer
------

The default mechanism works best with virtual domains, where the
generated address is not in the same domain. If you just want to pick up
all unknown local parts and send them to postmaster, an easier way to do
it is to put this as your last router:

    unknown:
      driver = redirect
      data = postmaster
      no_verify

Another possibility is to put the redirect router for these aliases
after all the other routers, so that local parts which are user names
get picked off first. You will need to have two aliasing routers if
there are some local parts (e.g. *root*) which are login names, but
which you want to handle as aliases.

It might also be possible to solve this dilemma by aliasing the accounts
that should not be covered by the wildcard to themselves as this takes
precedence over the wildcard. Adding

    luke: luke

to the alias file might solve the problem.
