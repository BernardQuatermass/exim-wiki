Q0421
=====

Question
--------

I can't get a regular expression to work in a `local_parts` option on
one of my routers.

Answer
------

Have you remembered to protect any backslash and dollar characters in
your regex from unwanted expansion? The easiest way is to use the `\N`
facility, like this:

    local_parts = \N^0740\d{6}\N
