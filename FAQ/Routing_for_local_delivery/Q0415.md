Q0415
=====

Question
--------

Can I use my existing alias files and forward files as well as procmail
and effectively drop in Exim in place of Sendmail ?

Answer
------

Yes, as long as your alias and forward files don't assume that pipes are
going to run under a shell. If they do, you either have to change them,
or configure Exim to use a shell (which it doesn't by default).
