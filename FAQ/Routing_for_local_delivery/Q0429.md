Question
--------

I would like to deliver mail addressed to a given domain to local
mailboxes, but also to generate messages to the envelope senders.

Answer
------

You can do this with an _unseen_ router and an **autoreply** transport, along the following lines:

    # Router
    auto_warning_r:
      driver = accept
      check_local_user
      domains = <domains you want to do this for>
      condition = ${if eq{$sender_address}{}{no}{yes}}
      transport = warning_t
      no_verify
      unseen

Place this router immediately before the normal **localuser** router.
The `unseen` option means that the address is still passed on to the
next router. The transport is configured like this:

    # Transport
    warning_t:
      driver = autoreply
      file = /usr/local/mail/warning.txt
      file_expand
      from = postmaster@your.domain
      to = $sender_address
      user = exim
      subject = Re: Your mail to $local_part@$domain

Note the use of the `condition` option to avoid attempting to send a
message when there is no sender (that is, when the incoming message is a
bounce message). You can of course extend this to include other
conditions. If you want to log the sending of messages, you can add

    log = /some/file

to the transport and also make use of the `once` option if you want to
send only one message to each sender.
