Q0427
=====

Question
--------

How can I have an address looked up in two different alias files, and
delivered to all the addresses that are found?

Answer
------

Use a router like this:

    multi_aliases:
      driver = redirect
      data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases1}\
        {$value${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases2}{,$value} } }\
        {${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases2}{$value}fail} } }\

If the first lookup succeeds, the result is its data, followed by the
data from the second lookup, if any, separated by a comma. If the first
lookup fails, the result is the data from the third lookup (which also
looks in the second file), but if this also fails, the entire expansion
is forced to fail, thereby causing the router to decline. Another
approach is to use two routers, with the first re-generating the
original local part when it succeeds. This won't get processed by the
same router again. For example:

    multi_aliases1:
      driver = redirect
      data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases1}{$value,$local_part}}

    multi_aliases2:
      data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases2}}

This scales more easily to three or more alias files.
