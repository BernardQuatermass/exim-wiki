Q0431
=====

Question
--------

How do I configure Exim to allow arbitrary extensions in local parts, of
the form *+extension*?

Answer
------

Add this pre-condition to the relevant router:

    local_part_suffix = +*

If you want the extensions to be optional, also add the option

    local_part_suffix_optional

When the router runs, *\$local\_part* contains the local part with the
extension removed, and the extension (if any) is in
*\$local\_part\_suffix*. If you have set `check_local_user`, the test is
carried out after the extension is removed.
