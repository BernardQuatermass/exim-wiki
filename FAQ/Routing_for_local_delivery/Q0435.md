Q0435
=====

Question
--------

My alias file contains fully qualified addresses as keys (as it was used
in sendmail's /etc/mail/virtualusertable), and some wildcard domains in
the form @foo.bar. Can Exim handle these?

Answer
------

You can handle fully qualified addresses with this router:

    qualified_aliases:
      driver = redirect
      data = ${lookup{$local_part@$domain}lsearch{/etc/aliases}}

(Add any other options you need for the **redirect** router.) Place this
router either before or after the default aliases router that looks up
the local part only. (Or, if you have no unqualified aliases, replace
the default router.) To handle wildcards in the form @foo.bar you will
need yet another router. (Wildcards of the form *@foo.bar can be handled
by an lsearch*@ lookup.) Something like this:

    wildcard_aliases:
      driver = redirect
      data = ${lookup{@$domain}lsearch{/etc/aliases}}

Place this after the routers that handle the more specific aliases.
