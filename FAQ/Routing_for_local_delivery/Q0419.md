Q0419

Question
--------

I have some obsolete domains which people have been warned not to use
any more. How can I arrange to delete any mail that is sent to them?

Answer
------

To reject them at SMTP time, with a customized error message, place
statments like this in the ACL:

    deny message = The domain $domain is obsolete
         domains = lsearch;/etc/exim/obsolete.domains

For messages that don't arrive over SMTP, you can use a router like this
to bounce them:

    obsolete:
      driver = redirect
      domains = lsearch;/etc/exim/obsolete.domains
      allow_fail
      data = :fail: the domain $domain is obsolete

If you just want to throw away mail to those domains, accept them at
SMTP time, and use a router like this:

    obsolete:
      domains = lsearch;/etc/exim/obsolete.domains
      data = :blackhole:
