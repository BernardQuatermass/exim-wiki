Q0422
=====

Question
--------

How can I arrange for all addresses in a group of domains
\**.example.com* to share the same alias file? I have a number of such
groups.

Answer
------

For a single group you could just hard wire the file name into a router
that had

    domains = *.example.com

set, to restrict it to the relevant domains. For a number of such groups
you can create a file containing the domains, like this:

    *.example1.com    example1.com
    *.example2.com    example2.com
    ...

Then create a router like this

    domain_aliases:
      driver = redirect
      domains = partial-lsearch;/that/file
      data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch*{/etc/aliases.d/$domain_data}}

The variable *\$domain\_data* contains the data that was looked up when
the `domains` option was matched, i.e. `example1.com`, `example2.com`,
etc. in this case.
