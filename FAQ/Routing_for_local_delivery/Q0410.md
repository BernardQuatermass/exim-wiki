Q0410
=====

Question
--------

How can I make Exim look in the alias NIS map instead of */etc/aliases*?

Answer
------

The default configuration does not use NIS (many hosts don't run it).
You need to change this line in the **system\_aliases** router:

    data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases}}

Change it to

    data = ${lookup{$local_part}nis{mail.aliases}}

If you want to use */etc/aliases* as well as NIS, put this router (with
a different name) before or after the default one, depending on which
data source you want to take precedence.
