Question
--------

How can I disable Exim's de-duplication features? I want it to do two
deliveries if two different aliases expand to the same address.

Answer
------

This is not possible. Duplication has other ramifications other than just (in)convenience. Consider: . Message is addressed to A and to B. . Both A and B are aliased to C. . Without de-duplication, two deliveries to C are scheduled. . One delivery happens, Exim records that it has delivered the message to C. . The next delivery fails (C's mailbox is over quota, say). Next time round, Exim wants to know if it has already delivered to C or not, before scheduling a new delivery. Has it? Obviously, if duplicate deliveries are supported, it has to remember not only that it has delivered to C but also the _history_ of how that delivery happened - in effect an ancestry list back to the

    duplicates:
      driver = accept
      local_parts = lsearch;/etc/list/of/special/local/parts
      transport = local_delivery
      user = exim
