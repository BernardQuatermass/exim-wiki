Question
--------

How do I arrange for all incoming email for \**@some.domain* to go into
one pop3 mail account? The customer doesn't want to add a list of
specific local parts to the system.

Answer
------

Set up a special transport that writes to the mailbox like this:

    special_transport:
      driver = appendfile
      file = /pop/mailbox
      envelope_to_add
      return_path_add
      delivery_date_add
      user = exim

The file will be written as the user `exim`. Then arrange to route all
mail for that domain to that transport, with a router like this:

    special_router:
      driver = accept
      domains = some.domain
      transport = special_transport
