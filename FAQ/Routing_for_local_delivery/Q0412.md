Q0412
=====

Question
--------

Why am I seeing the error *bad mode (100664) for /home/test/.forward*?
I've looked through the documentation but can't see anything to suggest
that Exim has to do anything other than read the *.forward* file.

Answer
------

For security, Exim checks for mode bits that shouldn't be set, by
default 022. You can change this by setting the `modemask` option of the
**redirect** router that is handling *.forward* files.
