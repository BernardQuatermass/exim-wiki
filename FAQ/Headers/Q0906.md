Q0906
=====

Question
--------

How do I reject messages that don't have a Message-ID header? How do I
fix MUAs that don't supply a Message-ID?.. qend

Answer
------

### How to check for it

RFC2822 says a Message-ID header SHOULD be present. Sometimes the lack
of a Message-ID is a spam indicator, so you might want to reject
messages which don't have a message-ID.

In the ACL that runs when the message body is inspected near the top
put:

    # Check for the presence of a Message-Id: header, which RFC2822 says SHOULD be present.
    # Some broken or misconfigured mailer software occasionally omits this from genuine  
    # messages too, though -- although it's not hard for the offender to fix 
    # after they receive a bounce because of it.
    #
    deny    condition  = ${if !def:h_Message-ID: {1}}
            message    = RFC2822 says that all mail SHOULD have a Message-ID header.\n\
                         Most messages without it are spam, so your mail has been rejected.

This may be named `acl_check_data` in which case you will have a line
`acl_smtp_data = acl_check_data` near the top of the config file.
