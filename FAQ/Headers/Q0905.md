Q0905
=====

Question
--------

I know I can use a system filter to replace certain headers in messages,
but how can I add text to existing headers? I want to add [SPAM] to the
subject line of messages that appear to be spam.

Answer
------

You can only do this in a round about way, using filter commands like
this:

    headers_add "New-Subject: SPAM: $h_subject:"
    headers_remove subject
    neaders_add "Subject: $h_new-subject:"
    headers_remove new-subject

This trick works only in system filters, where the commands are obeyed
in order, and affect the master list of headers that apply to the whole
message. You cannot do this with the `headers_add` and `headers_remove`
options on drivers.
