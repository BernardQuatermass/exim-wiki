Question
--------

Is it possible to have Exim add a header to only certain local parts of
outgoing mail?

Answer
------

Only if you arrange for each such local part to receive its own private
copy of the mail. See `max_rcpt` in the SMTP transport. If you set this
to 1, you could use conditions in an expansion string to add or not add
a header.
