Question
--------

I would like add some custom headers to selected outgoing mail based on
a specific domain and the subject line.

Answer
------

To the remote\_smtp transport, add something like

    headers_add = ${if and{\
                  {eq{$domain}{spec.dom}}\
                  {matches{$h_subject:}{whatever}} }\
                  {Content-Type: text/html; charset="us-ascii"} fail }

This example shows a *Content-Type:* header, but you can have anything
you like, and multiple headers can be inserted by using `\n` to separate
them.
