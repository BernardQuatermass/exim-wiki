Question
--------

On BSDI 4.0, Exim built with Perl support exits with the error message

    ./exim: can't load library 'libperl.so'

Answer
------

You probably compiled perl5 yourself, without looking into

    /usr/src/contrib/perl5/perl5.004_02/hints/bsdos.sh

first. The problem is that the command

    perl5 -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts

doesn't give you sufficient flags to link something with libperl. Since
5.004\_02 the *hints/bsdos.sh* file has changed to adapt to the changes
between BSDI 3.1 and 4.0, but it is still not entirely right. The
solution is, when you compile perl, change the `ccdlflags` variable in
config.sh to:

    -rdynamic -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.00502/i386-bsdos/CORE

(or something similar). Alternatively, you can run *./Configure* and
answering the question *Any special flags to pass to cc to use dynamic
loading?* with the above line. It is not known what **-rdynamic** means
(it's not apparently documented in any man page), but that's what BSDI
guys did to compile perl5 which comes with BSDI 4.0 distribution.
