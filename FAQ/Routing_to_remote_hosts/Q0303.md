Question

How do I configure Exim to send all messages to a central server? I
don't want to do any local deliveries at all on this host.

Answer

Use this as your first and only router:

    send_to_gateway:
      driver = manualroute
      transport = remote_smtp
      route_list = * central.server.host

* * * * *
