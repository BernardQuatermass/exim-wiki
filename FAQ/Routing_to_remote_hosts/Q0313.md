Q0313
=====

Question
--------

I send all external mail to a smart host, but this means that bad
addresses also get passed to the smart host. Can I avoid this?

Answer
------

Assuming you have DNS availability, set up a conventional **dnslookup**
router to do the routing, but in the **remote\_smtp** transport set
this:

    hosts = your.smart.host
    hosts_override

This will override the hosts that the router finds so that everything
goes to the smart host, but any non-existent domains will be failed by
the router.
