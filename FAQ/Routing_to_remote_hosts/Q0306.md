Q0306
=====

Question
--------

How do I configure Exim to send all non-local mail to a central server
if it cannot be immediately delivered by my host? I don't want to have
queued mail waiting on my host.

Answer
------

Add to the **remote\_smtp** transport the following:

    fallback_hosts = central.server.name(s)

If there are several names, they must be separated by colons.
