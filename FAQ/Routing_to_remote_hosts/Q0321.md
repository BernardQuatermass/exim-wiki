Q0321
=====

Question
--------

How can I tell an Exim router to use only IPv4 or only IPv6 addresses
when it finds both types in the DNS?

Answer
------

You can do this by making it ignore the addresses you don't want. This
example ignores all IPv6 addresses and all IPv4 addresses in the 127
network:

    ignore_target_hosts = <; 0000::0000/0 ; 127.0.0.0/8

To ignore all IPv4 addresses, use

    ignore_target_hosts = 0.0.0.0/0

See \`../Q0319\`\_ for a general discussion of `ignore_target_hosts`.
