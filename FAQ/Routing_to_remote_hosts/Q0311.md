Question
--------

When a DNS lookup for MX records fails to complete, why doesn't Exim
send the messsage to the host defined by the A record?

Answer
------

The RFCs are quite clear on this. Only if it is known that there are no MX records is an MTA allowed to make use of the A record. When an MX lookup fails to complete, Exim does not know whether there are any MX records or not. There seem to be some name servers (or some configurations of some name servers) that give a _server fail_ error when asked for a non-existent MX record. Exim uses standard
> resolver calls, which unfortunately do not distinguish between this
> case and a timeout, so all Exim can do is try again later.
