Q0319
=====

Question
--------

I have some mails on my queues that are sticking around longer than the
retry time indicates they should. They are all getting frozen because
some remote admin has set their MX record to 127.0.0.1.

Answer
------

The admin in question is an idiot. Exim will always freeze such messages
because they are apparently routed to the local host. To bounce these
messages immediately, set

    ignore_target_hosts = 127.0.0.1

on the **dnslookup** router. This causes Exim to completely ignore any
hosts with that IP address. In fact, there are quite a number of IP
addresses that should never be used. Here is a suggested configuration
list for the IPv4 ones:

    # Don't allow domains whose single MX (or A) record is a
    # "special-use IPv4 address", as listed in RFC 3330.
    ignore_target_hosts = \
                # Hosts on "this network"; RFC 1700 (page 4) states that these
                # are only allowed as source addresses
                0.0.0.0/8 : \
                # Private networks, RFC 1918
                10.0.0.0/8 : 172.16.0.0/12 : 192.168.0.0/16 : \
                # Internet host loopback address, RFC 1700 (page 5)
                127.0.0.0/8 : \
                # "Link local" block
                169.254.0.0/16 : \
                # "TEST-NET" - should not appear on the public Internet
                192.0.2.0/24 : \
                # 6to4 relay anycast addresses, RFC 3068
                192.88.99.0/24 : \
                # Network interconnect device benchmark testing, RFC 2544
                198.18.0.0/15 : \
                # Multicast addresses, RFC 3171
                224.0.0.0/4 : \
                # Reserved for future use, RFC 1700 (page 4)
                240.0.0.0/4
