Question
--------

I have a domain for which some local parts must be delivered locally,
but the remainder are to be treated like any other remote addresses.

Answer
------

One possible way of doing this is as follows: Assuming you are using a
configuration that is similar to the default one, first exclude your
domain from the first router by changing it to look like this:

    non_special_remote:
      driver = dnslookup
      domains = ! +local_domains : ! special.domain
      transport = remote_smtp
      ignore_target_hosts = 127.0.0.0/8
      no_more

Then add a second router to handle the local parts that are not to be
delivered locally:

    special_remote:
      driver = dnslookup
      domains = special.domain
      local_parts = ! lsearch;/list/of/special/localparts
      transport = remote_smtp
      ignore_target_hosts = 127.0.0.0/8
      no_more

The remaining local parts will fall through to the remaining routers,
which can delivery them locally.
