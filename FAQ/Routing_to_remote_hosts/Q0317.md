Q0317
=====

Question
--------

What I'd like to do is have alternative smart hosts, where the one to be
used is determined by which ISP I'm connected to.

Answer
------

The simplest way to do this is to arrange for the name of the smart host
du jour to be placed in a file when you connect, say */etc/smarthost*.
Then you can read this file from a **manualroute** router like this:

    smarthost:
      driver = manualroute
      transport = remote_smtp
      route_list = * ${readfile{/etc/smarthost}{}}

The second argument of the `readfile` item is a string that replaces any
newline characters in the file (in this case, with nothing). By keeping
the data out of the main configuration file, you avoid having to HUP the
daemon when it changes.

### Answer Two

To send all **none local domains** with an alternative server, you can
use the following setting. Add this section as first router.

    smarthost:
       driver = manualroute
       domains = ! +local_domains
       transport = remote_smtp
       route_list = * you.alternative.server.com
