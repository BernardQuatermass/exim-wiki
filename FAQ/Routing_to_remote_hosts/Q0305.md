Question
--------

How can I arrange for mail on my local network to be delivered directly
to the relevant hosts, but all other mail to be sent to my ISP's mail
server? The local hosts are all DNS-registered and behave like normal
Internet hosts.

Answer
------

Set up a first router to pick off all the domains for your local
network. There are several ways you might do this. For example

    local_network:
      driver = dnslookup
      transport = remote_smtp
      domains = *.mydomain.com

This does a perfectly conventional DNS routing operation, but only for
the domains that match \**.mydomain.com*. Follow this with a \`smart
host' router:

    internet:
      driver = manualroute
      domains = !+local_domains
      transport = remote_smtp
      route_list = * mail.isp.net

This routes any other non-local domains to the smart host.
