Question
--------

How can I configure Exim on a firewall machine so that if mail arrives
addressed to a domain whose MX points to the firewall, it is forwarded
to the internal mail server, without having to have a list of all the
domains involved?

Answer
------

As your first router, have the standard **dnslookup** router from the
default configuration, with the added option

    self = pass

This will handle all domains whose lowest numbered MX records do not
point to your host. Because of the `no_more` setting, if it encounters
an unknown domain, routing will fail. However, if it hits a domain whose
lowest numbered MX points to your host, the `self` option comes into
play, and overrides `no_more`. The `pass` setting causes it to pass the
address on to the next router. (The default causes it to generate an
error.) The only non-local domains that reach the second router are
those with MX records pointing to the local host. Set it up to send them
to the internal mail server like this:

    internal:
      driver = manualroute
      domains = ! +local_domains
      transport = remote_smtp
      route_list = * internal.server

* * * * *
