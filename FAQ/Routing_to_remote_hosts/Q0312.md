Q0312
=====

Question
--------

Is it possible to use a conditional expression for the host item in a
`route_list` for **manualroute** router? I tried the following, but it
doesn't work:

    route_list = * ${if match{$header_from:}{\N.*\.usa\.net$\N} \
                 {<smarthost1>}{<smarthost2>}

Answer
------

The problem is that the second item in `route_list` contains white
space, which means that it gets terminated prematurely. To avoid this,
you must put the second item in quotes:

    route_list = * "${if match{$header_from:}{\N.*\.usa\.net$\N} \
                 {<smarthost1>}{<smarthost2>}}"
