Q0307
=====

Question
--------

The `route_list` setting `^foo$:^bar$ $domain` in a **manualroute**
router does not work.

Answer
------

The first thing in a `route_list` item is a single pattern, not a list
of patterns. You need to write that as `^(foo|bar)$ $domain`.
Alternatively, you could use several items and write

    route_list = foo $domain; bar $domain

Note the semicolon separator. This is because the second thing in each
item can itself be a colon-separated list of hosts.
