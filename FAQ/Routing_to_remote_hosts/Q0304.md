Question

How do I configure Exim to send all non-local mail to a gateway host?

Answer
------

Replace the **dnslookup** router in the default configuration with the
following:

    send_to_gateway:
      driver = manualroute
      domains = !+local_domains
      transport = remote_smtp
      route_list = * gate.way.host

If there are several hosts you can send to, you can specify them as a
colon-separated list.
