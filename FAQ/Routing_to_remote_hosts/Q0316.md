Question
--------

I would like to forward all incoming email for a particular domain to
another host via SMTP. Whereabouts would I configure that?

Answer
------

Use this as your first router:

    special:
      driver = manualroute
      transport = remote_smtp
      route_list = the.particular.domain the.other.host

You will also need to adjust the ACL for incoming SMTP so that this
domain is accepted for relaying. If you are using the default
configuration, there is a domain list called `relay_domains` that is set
up for this.
