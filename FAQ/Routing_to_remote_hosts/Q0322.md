Q0322
=====

Question
--------

How can I reroute all messages bound for 192.168.10.0 and 10.0.0.0 to a
specific mail server?

Answer
------

That is an odd requirement. However, there is an obscure feature in
Exim, originally implemented for packet radio people, that perhaps can
help. Check out the `translate_ip_address` generic router option.
