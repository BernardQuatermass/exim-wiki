Question

How can I arrange for all mail to
[[user@some.domain](mailto:user@some.domain)](mailto:user@some.domain)
to be forwarded to
[[user@other.domain](mailto:user@other.domain)](mailto:user@other.domain)?

Answer

Put this as your first router:

    forward:
      driver = redirect
      domains = some.domain
      data = ${quote:$local_part}@other.domain
