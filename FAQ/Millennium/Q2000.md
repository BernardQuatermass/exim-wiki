Question
--------

Are there any Y2K issues with Exim?

Answer
------

The author of Exim believes that it is Y2K-compliant, as long as the
underlying operating system and C library are. Exim does not parse dates
or times at all. Internally, it makes some use of binary timestamps in
Unix format (number of seconds since 1-Jan-1970) and uses C library
services to convert these to printing forms (e.g. for logging). The
printing forms all use 4-digit years. Some people have tried various
tests. No problems have been reported, but details of what tests have
been done are not available. Well, it's now November 2001, and no Y2K
problems have been reported, so it looks like I was right. This entry is
retained as historical nostalgia.
