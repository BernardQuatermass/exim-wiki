Q9803
=====

Question
--------

A site for which I provide secondary MX is down for some time. Is there
a way to run the queue for that destination separately from the main
queue?

Answer
------

No, because Exim does not have the concept of .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

the queue for that destination.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

. It simply has a single pool of messages awaiting delivery (and some of
them may have several destinations). The best approach to this is to
arrange for all messages for the site to be saved somewhere other than
the main spool, either on a separate dedicated MTA, or in BSMTP files.
