Q9804

Question
--------

We want to be able to temporarily lock out a user by disabling the
password and moving the home directory to another place. How can we
arrange to reject mail for users in this state?

Answer
------

Change the home directory pointer in the passwd file to something
distinctive. For example, we use */home/CANCELLED* for cancelled users.
Then you can pick up such users with this router, which is placed
immediately after **system\_aliases**:

    cancelled_users:
      driver = redirect
      check_local_user
      condition = ${if eq {$home}{/home/CANCELLED}{yes}{no}}
      allow_fail
      data = :fail: this account is cancelled
