Q9807
=====

Question
--------

Is there any way to have messages sent to a specific local address
delayed by - say - 24 hours?

Answer
------

Set up a router like this:

    delay:
      driver = redirect
      domains = the.domain
      local_parts = thelocalpart
      condition = ${if < {$message_age}{86400}{yes}{no}}
      allow_defer
      data = :defer: message not old enough
      no_verify

Of course, this will also have the effect of setting a retry time for
the address. You may want to set a special retry rule for it. Note the
use of `no_verify` to ensure that this router is not used when Exim is
verifying addresses.
