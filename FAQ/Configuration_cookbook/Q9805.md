Question
--------

How can I configure Exim so that all mails addressed to
[[something@username.domain.net](mailto:something@username.domain.net)](mailto:something@username.domain.net)
get delivered to */var/spool/mail/username*?

Answer
------

Assuming that you have set up *username* as a normal user, with
conventional routing for
[[username@domain.net](mailto:username@domain.net)](mailto:username@domain.net)
to that mailbox, all you need to do is set up a redirection, using a
router like this:

    user_in_domain:
      driver = redirect
      data = ${if match{$domain}{\N^(.*)\.domain\.net$\N}\
             {$1}fail}@domain.net

If you set `envelope_to` in the **appendfile** transport, the original
envelope address is preserved in the message in an *Envelope-to:* header
line.
