Question
--------

How do I configure Exim so that it sends mail to the outside world only
from a restricted list of our local users?

Answer
------

You will need to have a convenient way of checking the list. If it is
only a handful of users, you could just list them inline. Otherwise, you
need to put them in a file or database. Let's suppose you've just got a
list in a file. Put this as your first router:

    check_outgoing:
      driver = redirect
      domains = ! +local_domains
      senders = ! : ! lsearch;/etc/permitted/senders
      allow_fail
      data = :fail: you are not allowed to send outside

The senders should be listed as complete addresses, with both a local
part and a domain. For a large list, use a DBM or cdb file instead, or a
database. The first item in the `senders` list is empty, to match the
empty sender. This is necessary because bounce messages have null
senders.
