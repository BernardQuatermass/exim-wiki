Q9809
=====

Question
--------

Can I configure Exim so that my gateway host sends a copy of each
incoming message to each of two internal hosts?

Answer
------

The easiest way to do this is to make use of the `unseen` router option,
and set up two separate routers. You need to be able to identify
incoming messages somehow. Typically this can be done by testing the
domain of the recipient address, in which case the configuration should
contain something like this:

    r1:
      driver = manualroute
      domains = ! *.your.domain.example
      route_data = host1.your.domain.example
      transport = remote_smtp
      unseen

    r2:
      driver = manualroute
      domains = ! *.your.domain.example
      route_data = host2.your.domain.example
      transport = remote_smtp

The `unseen` setting on **r1** means that after it has accepted an
address, the address is also passed on to **r2**, and so two deliveries
occur.
