Question
--------

How do I configure Exim as part of TPC
([http://www.tpc.int)](http://www.tpc.int))?

Answer
------

Suppose you want to accept faxes destined for 1(801)539-*. These are
addressed to the domain*9.3.5.1.0.8.1.tpc.int\*. Set up a transport to
handle the delivery:

    tpc:
      driver = pipe
      command = /usr/local/tpc/tpcmailer.pl $local_part@$domain \
        $sender_address
      pipe_as_creator

*/usr/local/tpc/tpcmailer.pl* is the mail processing script that can be
obtained from the TPC distribution. Create a router to route mail for
the TPC domain to that transport. This must be placed before your other
routers:

    tpc_router:
      driver = accept
      transport = tpc
      domains = *.9.3.5.1.0.8.1.tpc.int

Of course, there are other things to do as well before your system is a
functioning TPC server.
