Q9812
=====

Question
--------

How can I lookup data from a single file using both single IP addresses
and IP address blocks as keys? I want to set `smtp_accept_max_per_host`
by this means, and also include a default.

Answer
------

You cannot do this in a single lookup, because you need separate lookups
for individual addresses and address blocks. However, these lookups can
be nested in a single expansion string. For example, suppose you are
using an lsearch file with entries like this:

    192.168.34.35:    4
    192.168.34.0/24:  2
    *:                1

You can use this setting:

    smtp_accept_max_per_host = \
      ${lookup{$sender_host_address}lsearch{/path/to/file}\
      {$value}\
      {\
      ${lookup{${mask:$sender_host_address/24}}lsearch*{/path/to/file}}\
      }}

Note that the first lookup does not have an asterisk on the search type.
If you have blocks of different sizes (/24, /26, etc) you have to
configure it to do a separate lookup for each size, with just the final
one using a default.
