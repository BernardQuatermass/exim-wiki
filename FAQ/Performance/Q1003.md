Question
--------

We have a large password file. Can Exim use alternative lookups during
delivery to speed things up?

Answer
------

If you are using FreeBSD, this problem should not arise, because it
automatically uses an indexed password file. In some other operating
systems you can arrange for this to happen too. On Linux, for example,
all you need to do is

    # cd /var/db
    # make

and put `db` before `files` in any */etc/nsswitch.conf* lines you want
to use db for. On systems that do not include support for indexed
password files, you can build one yourself, and reference it from the
Exim configuration. For example, for routing to local mailboxes you
could use this:

    localuser:
      driver = accept
      condition = ${lookup{$local_part}cdb{/etc/passwd.cdb}{yes}{no}}
      transport = local_delivery
      user = ${extract{1}{:}{${lookup{$local_part}cdb{/etc/passwd.cdb

}}} This assumes a cdb version of the password file.
