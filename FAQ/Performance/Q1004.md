Question

I just wondered if it might be helpful to put the hints database on a
RAM disk during regular operation. Did anybody try that yet?

I have found that this works great under Solaris. Make a RAM disk partition and keep everything in the .. raw:: html

db *directory on it. However, when I try the same thing on Linux, I don't see the same boost. I think that Linux's file buffer cache works about the same. Plus, this leave more room for processes to run.* There have been other reports that Linux's delayed buffer write provides better overall performance in general. Apparently there is support in the Solaris kernel for a delayed writing, as in Linux, but Sun's server policy is to have it disabled so that you don't lose so much if the server crashes. There is a program called *fastfs* to enable and disable this support. You have to download and compile it yourself; find it by looking for `fastfs.c` in a search engine. Solaris performance is reported to be much improved, but you should take care to understand the potential hazards. In particular, *fsck* may be unable to .. raw:: html
