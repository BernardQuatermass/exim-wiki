Question
--------

I'm running a large mail server. Should I set `split_spool_directory` to
improve performance?

Answer
------

Splitting the spool directory has most benefit if there are times when
there are a large number of messages on the queue. If all mail is
delivered very quickly, and the queue is always less than, say, a few
hundred messages, there isn't any need to do this. With larger queues,
there is a definite performance benefit to splitting the spool. It shows
up earlier on some types of file system, compared with others. Exim was
not designed for handling large queues. If you are in an enviroment
where lots of messages remain on the queue for long periods of time,
consider implementing a back up host to which you pass these messages,
so that the main host's queue remains short. You can use
`fallback_hosts` to do this, or a router that is conditional on
*\$message\_age*.
