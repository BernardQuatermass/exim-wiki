Q1005
=====

Question
--------

A lot of incoming mail is pushing up my system load too much, and there
are many Exim processes. How can I control this?

Answer
------

Have you set any of the Exim configuration options that limit what it
does under high load? For example, queue\_only\_load,
deliver\_queue\_load\_max? See the list in the section entitled
*Resource control* in the manual. It sounds like a lot of simultaneous
incoming mail pushes your system into uncontrolled overload. The
multiple Exim processes are probably just multiple incoming messages.
You can use the *exiwhat* utility to confirm this.
