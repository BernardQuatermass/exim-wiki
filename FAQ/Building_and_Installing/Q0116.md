Q0116
=====

Question
--------

I have tried to build Exim with Berkeley DB 3 and 4, but I always get
errors.

Answer
------

One common problem, especially when you have several different versions
of BDB installed on the same host, is that the header files and library
files for BDB are not in a standard place. You therefore need to tell
Exim where they are, by setting INCLUDE and DBMLIB in your
*Local/Makefile*. For example, you could use this when you want to build
with DB 4.1:

    INCLUDE=-I/usr/local/include/db-4.1
    DBMLIB=/usr/local/lib/db-4.1/libdb.a

Specifying the complete library file like this will cause it to be
statically linked with Exim. You'll have to check to see where these
files are on your system. For example, on FreeBSD 5, the header is in
*/usr/local/include/db4* and the library is in */usr/local/lib* and
called *libdb4*. In that environment, you could use:

    INCLUDE=-I/usr/local/include/db4
    DBMLIB=-L/usr/local/lib -ldb4

This time, DBMLIB is specifying the library directory (*/usr/local/lib*)
and the name of the library (*db4*) separately. The name of the actual
library file is */usr/local/lib/libdb4.something*. If the library was
compiled for dynamic linking, that will be used.
