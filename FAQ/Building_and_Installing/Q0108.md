Q0108
=====

Question
--------

I'm getting an unresolved symbol `ldap_is_ldap_url` when trying to build
Exim.

Answer
------

You must have specified `LOOKUP_LDAP=yes` in the configuration. Have you
remembered to set `-lldap` somewhere (e.g. in
\<small\>LOOKUP\_LIBS\</small\>)? You need that in order to get the LDAP
library scanned when linking.
