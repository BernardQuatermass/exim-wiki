Q0115
=====

Question
--------

What does *Can't open* ../scripts/newer*: No such file or directory*
mean? I got it while trying to build Exim.

Answer
------

You are using FreeBSD, or another OS that has a *make* command which
tries to optimize the running of commands. Exim's *Makefile* contains
targets with sequential commands like this:

    buildpcre:
      @cd pcre; $(MAKE) SHELL=$(SHELL) AR="$(AR)" $(MFLAGS) CC="$(CC)" \
        CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS) $(PCRE_CFLAGS)" \
        RANLIB="$(RANLIB)" HDRS="$(PHDRS)" \
        INCLUDE="$(INCLUDE) $(IPV6_INCLUDE) $(TLS_INCLUDE)"
      @if $(SHELL) $(SCRIPTS)/newer pcre/libpcre.a exim; then \
        /bin/rm -f exim eximon.bin; fi

The second command assumes that the `cd pcre` in the first command is no
longer in effect. If you have `-j3` in your default set of `MAKEFLAGS`,
FreeBSD *make* tries to optimize, and ends up up with both commands in
the same shell process. The result is that `$(SCRIPTS)` (which has a
value of `../scripts`) is not found. The simplest solution is to force
*make* to use backwards compatibility mode with each command in its own
shell, by using the `-B` flag. To ensure that this happens throughout
the build, it's best to export it in your environment:

    MAKEFLAGS='-B'
    ort MAKEFLAGS
    e
