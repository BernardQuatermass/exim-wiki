Q0105
=====

Question
--------

What does the error *install-info: command not found* mean?

Answer
------

You have set \<small\>INFO\_DIRECTORY\</small\> in your
*Local/Makefile*, and Exim is trying to install the Texinfo
documentation, but cannot find the command called *install-info*. If you
have a version of Texinfo prior to 3.9, you should upgrade. Otherwise,
check your installation of Texinfo to see why the *install-info* command
is not available.
