Q0102
=====

Question
--------

I can't get Exim to compile with Berkeley DB version 2.x or 3.x.

Answer
------

Have you set `"USE_DB=yes`" in *Local/Makefile*? This causes Exim to use
the native interface to the DBM library instead of the compatibility
interface, which needs a header called *ndbm.h* that may not exist on
your system.
