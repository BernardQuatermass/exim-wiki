Q0109
=====

Question
--------

I'm getting an unresolved symbol `mysql_close` when trying to build
Exim.

Answer
------

You must have specified `LOOKUP_MYSQL=yes` in the configuration. Have
you remembered to set `-lmysqlclient` somewhere (e.g. in
\<small\>LOOKUP\_LIBS\</small\>)? You need that in order to get the
MySQL library scanned when linking.
