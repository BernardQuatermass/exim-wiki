Question
--------

I've compiled Exim and I've managed to start it but there was one
problem - it always complained that *libmsqlclient.so.10* was not found,
even though this file is in */usr/local/lib/mysql/*.

Answer
------

Solaris: ensure you have this in your *Local/Makefile*:

    LOOKUP_LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib/mysql -R/usr/local/lib/mysql

Net/Open/FreeBSD: Run this command (or ensure it gets run automatically
at boot time):

    ldconfig -m /usr/local/lib/mysql

Linux: add */usr/local/lib/mysql* to */etc/ld.so.conf* and re-run
*ldconfig*. Alternatively, add

    -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/local/lib/mysql

to EXTRA\_LIBS and then re-link (this is similar to the Solaris solution
above). This will probably also work on other systems that use GNU
Binutils.
