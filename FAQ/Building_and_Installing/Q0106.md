Q0106
=====

Question
--------

Exim doesn't seem to be recognizing my operating system type correctly,
and so is failing to build.

Answer
------

Run the command `scripts/os-type -generic`. The output should be one of
the known OS types, and should correspond to your operating system. You
can see which OS are supported by obeying `ls OS/Makefile-*` and looking
at the file name suffixes. If there is a discrepancy, it means that the
script is failing to interpret the output from the `uname` command
correctly, or that the output is wrong. Meanwhile, you can build Exim by
obeying

    EXIM_OSTYPE=xxxx make

instead of just `make`, provided you are running a Bourne-compatible
shell, or otherwise by setting \<small\>EXIM\_OSTYPE\</small\> correctly
in your environment. It is probably best to start again from a clean
distribution, to avoid any wreckage left over from the failed attempt.
