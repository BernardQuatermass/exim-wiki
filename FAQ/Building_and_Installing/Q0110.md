Q0110
=====

Question
--------

I'm trying to build Exim with PAM support. I have included `-lpam` in
\<small\>EXTRALIBS\</small\>, but I'm still getting a linking error:

    /lib/libpam.so: undefined reference to `dlerror'
    /lib/libpam.so: undefined reference to `dlclose'
    /lib/libpam.so: undefined reference to `dlopen'
    /lib/libpam.so: undefined reference to `dlsym'

Answer
------

Add `-ldl` to \<small\>EXTRALIBS\</small\>. In some systems these
dynamic loading functions are in their own library.
