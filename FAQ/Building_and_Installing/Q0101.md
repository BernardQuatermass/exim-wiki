Q0101
=====

Question
--------

I'm having a problem with an Exim RPM.

Answer
------

Normally the thing to do if you have a problem with an RPM package is to
contact the person who built the package first, not the person who made
the software that's in the package. You can usually find out who made a
package using the following command:

    rpm --query --package --queryformat '%{PACKAGER}\n' <rpm-package-file>

where *rpm-package-file* is the actual file, e.g.
*exim-3.03-2.i386.rpm*. Or, if the package is installed on your system:

    rpm --query --queryformat '%{PACKAGER}\n' <package-name>

where *package-name* is the name component of the package, e.g. `exim`.
If the packager is unable or unwilling to help, only then should you
contact the actual author or associated mailing list of the software. If
you discover through the querying process that you can't tell who the
person (or company or group) is who built the package, or that they no
longer exist at the given address, then you should reconsider whether
you want a package from an unknown source on your system. If you
discover through the querying process that you yourself are the person
who built the package, then you should either (a) contact the author or
associated mailing list, or (b) reconsider whether you ought to be
building and distributing RPM packages of software you don't understand.
Similar rules of thumb govern other binary package formats, including
debs, tarballs, and POSIX packages.
