Question
--------

I'm getting the error *db.h: No such file or directory* when I try to
build Exim.

Answer
------

This problem has been seen with RedHat\_ 7.0, but could also happen in
other environments. If your system is using the DB library, you need to
install the DB development package in order to build Exim. The package
is called something like `db3-devel-3.1.14-16.i386.rpm` for Linux
systems, but you should check which version of DB you have installed
(current releases are DB 4).
