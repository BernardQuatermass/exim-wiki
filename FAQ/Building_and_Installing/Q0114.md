Q0114
=====

Question
--------

How can I remove Sendmail from my system? I've built Exim and run
`make install`, but it still doesn't seem to be fully operational.

Answer
------

If you are running FreeBSD, see \`FAQ/FreeBSD/Q9201\`\_. Otherwise, you
need to arrange that whichever of the paths */usr/sbin/sendmail* or
*/usr/lib/sendmail* exists on your system is changed to refer to Exim.
For example, you could use these commands (as *root*):

    mv /usr/sbin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail.original
    chmod u-s /usr/sbin/sendmail.original
    ln -s /path/to/exim /usr/sbin/sendmail

The second command removes the setuid privilege from the old MTA, as a
general safety precaution. In the third command, substitute the actual
path to the Exim binary for */path/to/exim*.
