Question
--------

Is there a quick walk-through of an Exim install from source anywhere?

Answer
------

Here! This is a contribution from a Red Hat user, somewhat edited. On
other operating systems things may be slightly different, but the
general approach is the same.

1.  Install the db needed for Exim. This needs to be done first if you t
    have a DBM library installed. Go to
    [http://www.sleepycat.com](http://www.sleepycat.com) download
    *db-4.1.25.tar.gz*, or whatever the current release is. :

<!-- -->

    gunzip db-4.1.25.tar.gz
    tar -xvf db-4.1.25.tar
    cd db-4.1.25
    cd build_unix
    ../dist/configure
    make
    make install

1.  Add a user for use by Exim, unless you want to use an existing user
    as *mail*:

<!-- -->

    adduser exim

1.  Now you can prepare to build Exim. Go to
    [http://www.exim.org](http://www.exim.org) or of its mirrors, or the
    master ftp site
    [ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/email/exim/exim4](ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/email/exim/exim4)
    , and download `exim-4.20.tar.gz` or whatever the current release
    is. Then:

<!-- -->

    gunzip exim-4.20.tar.gz
    tar -xvf exim-4.20.tar
    cd exim-4.20
    cp src/EDITME Local/Makefile
    cp exim_monitor/EDITME Local/eximon.conf

1.  Edit *Local/Makefile*:

Comment out EXIM\_MONITOR= unless you want to install the Exim monitor
(it requires X-windows). Set the user you want Exim to use for itself:

    EXIM_USER=exim

If your DBM library is Berkeley DB, set up to use its native interface:

    USE_DB=yes

Make sure Exim's build can find the DBM library and its headers. If
you've installed Berkeley DB 4 you'll need to have settings like this in
*Local/Makefile*:

    INCLUDE=-I/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.1/include
    DBMLIB=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.1/lib/libdb.a

(Check that the first directory contains the db.h file and that the second library exists.) You don't need to change anything else, but you might want to review the default settings in the .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

must specify.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> section.

1.  Build Exim by running the *make* command.

2.  Install Exim by running, as *root*:

<!-- -->

    make install

You must be *root* to do this. You do not have to be root for any of the
previous building activity.

1.  Run some tests on Exim; see if it will do local and remote veries. Change the configuration if necessary (for example, mmenting `group` on the **local\_delivery** transport if you don't a .. raw:: html
    :   &\#147;

    sticky bit.. raw:: html
    :   &\#148;

    > directory).

2.  Change Sendmail to Exim (of course you need to have had Sendmail
    alled to do this).

<!-- -->

    /etc/init.d/sendmail stop
    mv /usr/sbin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail.org
    ln -s /usr/exim/bin/exim /usr/sbin/sendmail
    /etc/init.d/sendmail start

1.  Check the Exim log. Either use the Exim monitor, or:

<!-- -->

    tail -f /var/spool/exim/log/mainlog
