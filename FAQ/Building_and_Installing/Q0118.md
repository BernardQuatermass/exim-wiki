Q0118
=====

Question
--------

I've set `LOOKUP_INCLUDE=-I/client/include` in Local/Makefile, but the
compilation of *exim\_dumpdb* is ignoring this option and failing. Why?

Answer
------

LOOKUP\_INCLUDE is the special include file for lookup modules in Exim
(e.g. mysql, LDAP). Confusingly, it doesn't apply to basic DBM code
which is used also for other things. Try setting INCLUDE and DBMLIB
instead. For example:

    USE_DB=yes
    INCLUDE=-I/client/include
    DBMLIB=/client/lib/libdb.a
