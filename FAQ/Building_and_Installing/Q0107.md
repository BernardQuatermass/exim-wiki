Q0107

Question
--------

Exim fails to build, complaining about the absence of the `killpg`
function.

Answer
------

This function should be present in all modern flavours of Unix. If you
are using an older version, you should be able to get round the problem
by inserting

    #define killpg(pgid,sig)   kill(-(pgid),sig)

into the file called *OS/os.h-xxx*, where xxx identifies your operating
system, and is the output of the command `scripts/os-type -generic`.
