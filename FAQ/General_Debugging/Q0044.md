Question
--------

What does the error *Failed to create spool file* mean?

Answer
------

Exim has been unable to create a file in its spool area in which to
store an incoming message. This is most likely to be either a
permissions problem in the file hierarchy, or a problem with the uid
under which Exim is running, though it could be something more drastic
such as your disk being full. If you are running Exim with an alternate
configuration file using a command such as `exim -C altconfig...`,
remember that the use of -C takes away Exim's root privilege. Check that
you have defined the spool directory correctly by running

    exim -bP spool_directory

and examining the output. Check the mode of this directory. It should
look like this, assuming you are running Exim as user *exim*:

    drwxr-x---   6 exim  exim      512 Jul 16 12:29 /var/spool/exim

If there are any subdirectories already in existence, they should have
the same permissions, owner, and group. Check also that you haven't got
incorrect permissions on superior directories (for example,
*/var/spool*). Check that you have set up the Exim binary to be setuid
*root*. It should look like this:

    -rwsr-xr-x   1 root     xxx       502780 Jul 16 14:16 exim

Note that it is not just the owner that must be *root*, but also the
third permission must be `s` rather than `x`.
