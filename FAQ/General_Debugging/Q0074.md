Q0074
=====

Question
--------

What does the error message *remote delivery process count got out of
step* mean?

Answer
------

Exim uses subprocesses for remote deliveries; this error means that the master process expected to have a child process running, but found there were none. Prior to release 4.11, this error could be caused by running Exim under *strace* on a Linux system, because stracing causes children to be .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

stolen.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

such that a parent that tries to wait for .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

any of my children.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> is told that it has none. Current releases of Exim have code to get
> round this problem.
