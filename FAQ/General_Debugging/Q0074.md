Question
--------

What does the error message *remote delivery process count got out of
step* mean?

Answer
------

Exim uses subprocesses for remote deliveries; this error means that the master process expected to have a child process running, but found there were none. Prior to release 4.11, this error could be caused by running Exim under *strace* on a Linux system, because stracing causes children to be  stolen such that a parent that tries to wait for  any of my children > is told that it has none. Current releases of Exim have code to get
> round this problem.
