Q0085
=====

Question
--------

I see a lot of *rejected EHLO ... syntactically invalid argument(s)*. I
know it's because of the underscore in the host name, but is there a
switch to allow Exim to accept mail from such hosts?

Answer
------

Yes. Add this to your configuration:

    helo_allow_chars = _

For more seriously malformed host names, see `helo_accept_junk_hosts`.
