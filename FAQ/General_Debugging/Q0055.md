Q0055
=====

Question
--------

What does the error *Failed to open wait-remote\_smtp database: Invalid
argument* mean?

Answer
------

This is something that happens if you have existing DBM hints files when
you install a new version of Exim that is compiled to use a different or
upgraded DBM library. The simplest thing to try is

    rm /var/spool/exim/db/*

This removes all the hints files. Exim will start afresh and build new
ones. If the symptom recurs, it suggests there is some problem with your
DBM library.
