Question
--------

What does the error *failed to open DB file* /var/spool/exim/db/retry*:
File exists* mean?

Answer
------

This error is most often caused when a hints file that was written with
one version of the Berkeley DB library is read by another version.
Sometimes this can happen if you change from a binary version of Exim to
a locally compiled version. Or it can happen if you compile and install
a new version of Exim after changing Berkeley DB versions. You can find
out which version your Exim is using by running:

    ldd /usr/sbin/exim

The solution to the problem is to delete all the files in the
*/var/spool/exim/db* directory, and let Exim recreate them.
