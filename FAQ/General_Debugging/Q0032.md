Q0032
=====

Question
--------

Exim is failing to find the MySQL library, even though is it present
within \<small\>LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH\</small\>. I'm getting this error:

    /usr/local/bin/exim: fatal: libmysqlclient.so.6: open failed:
    No such file or directory

Answer
------

Exim is suid, and \<small\>LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH\</small\> is ignored for
suid binaries on a Solaris (and other?) systems. What you should be
doing is adding `-R/local/lib/mysql` to the same place in the
compilation that you added `-L/local/lib/mysql`. This tells the binary
where to look without needing a path variable.
