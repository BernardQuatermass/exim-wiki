Q0005
=====

Question
--------

Why is Exim not rejecting incoming messages addressed to non-existent
users at SMTP time?

Answer
------

This is controlled by the ACL that is run for each incoming RCPT
command. It is defined by the `acl_smtp_rcpt` option. You can check this
part of your configuration by using the **-bh** option to run a
simulated SMTP session, during which Exim will tell you what things it
is checking.
