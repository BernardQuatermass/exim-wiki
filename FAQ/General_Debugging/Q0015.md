Q0015
=====

Question
--------

What does the message *Socket bind() to port 25 for address (any)
failed: address already in use* mean?

Answer
------

You are trying to run an Exim daemon when there is one already running -
or maybe some other MTA is running, or perhaps you have an SMTP line in
*/etc/inetd.conf* which is causing *inetd* to listen on port 25.
