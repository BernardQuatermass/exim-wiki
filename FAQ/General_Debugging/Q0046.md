Q0046
=====

Question
--------

A short time after I start Exim I see a defunct zombie process. What is
causing this?

Answer
------

Your system must be lightly loaded as far as mail is concerned. The
daemon sets off a queue runner process when it is started, but it only
tidies up completed child processes when it wakes up for some other
reason. When there's nothing much going on, you occasionally see defunct
processes like this waiting to be dealt with. This is perfectly normal.
