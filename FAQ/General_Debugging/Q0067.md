Question
--------

What does the error *too many unrecognized commands* mean?

Answer
------

There have been instances of network abuse involving mail sent out by
web servers. In most cases, unrecognizable commands are sent as part of
the SMTP session. A real MTA never sends out such invalid commands. Exim
allows a few unrecognized commands in a session to permit humans who are
testing to make a few typos (it responds with a 5xx error). However, if
Exim receives too many such commands, it assumes that it is dealing with
an abuse of some kind, and so it drops the connection.
