Question
--------

How can I stop undeliverable bounce messages (e.g. to routeable, but
undeliverable, spammer senders) from clogging up the queue for days?

Answer
------

If at all possible, you should try to avoid getting into this situation
in the first place, for example, by verifying recipients so that you do
not accept undeliverable messages that lead to these bounces. You can,
however, configure Exim to discard failing bounce messages early. Just
set `ignore_bounce_errors_after` to specify a (short) time to keep them
for.
