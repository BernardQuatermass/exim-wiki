Q0007
=====

Question
--------

I've put the entry `*@domain.com` in a lookup database, but it isn't
working. The expansion I'm using is:

    ${lookup{${lc:$sender_address}}dbm{/the/file} ...

Answer
------

As no sender address will ever be **@domain.com* this will indeed have
no effect as it stands. You need to tell Exim that you want it to look
for defaults after the normal lookup has failed. In this case, change
the search type from `dbm` to `dbm*@`. See the section on*Default values
in single-key lookups\* in the chapter entitled *File and database
lookups* in the Exim manual.
