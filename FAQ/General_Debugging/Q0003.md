Q0003

Question
--------

What does the error *Child process of address\_pipe transport returned
127 from command xxx* mean?

Answer
------

It means that when a transport called **address\_pipe** was run to pass
an email message by means of a pipe to another process running the
command xxx, the return code from that command was 127, which indicates
some kind of error (the success return code is 0). The most common
meaning of exit code 127 is that when Exim tried to run the command
*xxx*, it failed. One cause of this might be incorrect permissions on
the file containing the command. See also \`../Q0026\`\_.
