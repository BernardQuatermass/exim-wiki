Question
--------

What does *failed to create child process to send failure message* mean?
This is a busy mail server with `smtp_accept_max` set to 500, but this
problem started to occur at about 300 incoming connections.

Answer
------

Some message delivery failed, and when Exim wanted to send a bounce
message, it was unable to create a process in which to do so. Probably
the limit on the maximum number of simultaneously active processes has
been reached. Most OS have some means of increasing this limit, and in
some operating systems there is also a limit per uid which can be
varied.
