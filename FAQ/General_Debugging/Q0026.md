Question
--------

I'm trying to get Exim to connect an alias to a pipe, but it always
gives error code 127, with the comment *(could mean unable to exec or
command does not exist)*.

Answer
------

If your alias entry looks like this:

    alias:  |"/some/command some parameters"

change it to look like this:

    alias:  "|/some/command some parameters"
