Q0001
=====

Question
--------

Exim is crashing. What is wrong?

Answer
------

Exim should never crash. The author is always keen to know about
crashes, so that they can be diagnosed and fixed. However, before you
start sending me email, please check that you are running the latest
release of Exim, in case the problem has already been fixed. The
techniques described below can also be useful in trying to pin down
exactly which circumstances caused the crash and what Exim was trying to
do at the time. If the crash is reproducible (by a particular message,
say) keep a copy of that message.
