Q0048
=====

Question
--------

Whenever exim restarts it takes up to 3-5 minutes to start responding on
the SMTP port. Why is this?

Answer
------

Something else is hanging onto port 25 and not releasing it. One place
to look is */etc/inetd.conf* in case for any reason an SMTP stream is
configured there.
