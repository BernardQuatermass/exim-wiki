Question
--------

The Windows mailer SENDFILE.EXE sometimes hangs while trying to send a
message to Exim 4, and eventually times out. It worked flawlessly with
Exim 3. What has changed?

Answer
------

Exim 4 sets an obscure TCP/IP parameter called TCP\_NODELAY. This
disables the "Nagle algorithm" for the TCP/IP transmission. The Nagle
algorithm can improve network performance in interactive situations such
as a human typing at a keyboard, by buffering up outgoing data until the
previous packet has been acknowledged, and thereby reducing the number
of packets used. This is not relevant for mail transmission, which
mostly consists of quite large blocks of data; setting TCP\_NODELAY
should improve performance. However, it seems that some Windows clients
do not function correctly if the server turns off the Nagle algorithm.
If you are using Exim 4.23 or later, you can set

    tcp_nodelay = false

This stops Exim setting TCP\_NODELAY on the sockets created by the
listening daemon.
