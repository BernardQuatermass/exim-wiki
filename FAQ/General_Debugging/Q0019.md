Q0019
=====

Question
--------

There seems to be a problem in the string expansion code: it doesn't
recognize references to headers such as `${h_to}`.

Answer
------

The only valid syntax for header references is (for example) `$h_to:`
because header names are permitted by RFC 2822 to contain a very wide
range of characters. A colon (or white space) is required as the
terminator.
