Q0027
=====

Question
--------

What does the error *Spool file is locked* mean?

Answer
------

This is not an error. All it means is that when an Exim delivery process
(probably started by a queue runner process) looked at a message in
order to start delivering it, it found that another Exim process was
already busy delivering it. On a busy system this is quite a common
occurrence. If you set `-skip_delivery` in the `log_selector` option,
these messages are omitted from the log. The only time when this message
might indicate a problem is if it is repeated for the same message for a
very long time. That would suggest that the process that is delivering
the message has somehow got stuck.
