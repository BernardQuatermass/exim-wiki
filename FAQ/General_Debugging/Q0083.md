Question
--------

Netscape on Unix is sending messages containing an unqualified user name
in the *Sender:* header line, which Exim is rejecting because I have set
`verify = header_syntax`. How can I fix this?

Answer
------

The only thing you can do in Exim is to set the
`sender_unqualified_hosts` option to allow unqualified sender addresses
form the relevant hosts; of course, this applies to all sender
addresses, not just the *Sender:* header line. Alternatively, you can
configure Netscape not to include the header line in the first place.
Add the following line to the *\$HOME/.netscape/preferences.js* and
*\$HOME/.netscape/liprefs.js* files:

    user_pref("mail.suppress_sender_header", true);

Netscape must be shut down while doing this.
