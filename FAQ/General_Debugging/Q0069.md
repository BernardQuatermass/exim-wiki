Question
--------

What does the error *SMTP data timeout (message abandoned) on connection
from...* mean?

Answer
------

It means that there was a timeout while Exim was reading the contents of a message on an incoming SMTP connection. That is, it had successfully accepted a MAIL command, one or more RCPT commands, and a DATA command, and was in the process of reading the data itself. The length of timeout is controlled by the `smtp_receive_timeout` option. If you get this error regularly, the cause may be incorrect handling of large packets by a router or firewall. The maximum size of a packet is restricted on some links; routers should split packets that are larger. There is a feature called .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

path MTU discovery.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> that enables a sender to discover the maximum packet size over an
