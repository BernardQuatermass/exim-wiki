Q0087
=====

Question
--------

What does *rejected after DATA: malformed address: xx@yy may not follow
\<xx@yy\> : failing address in "from" header* mean?

Answer
------

Your DATA ACL contains

    verify = header_syntax

and an incoming message contained the line

    From: xx@yy <xx@yy>

This is syntactically invalid. The contents of an address in a header line are either just the address, or a .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

phrase.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

followed by an address in angle brackets. In the latter case, the .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

phrase.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> must be quoted if it contains special characters such as @. The
> following are valid versions of the bad header:

    From: xx@yy
    From: "xx@yy" <xx@yy>

though why on earth anything generates this kind of redundant nonsense I
can't think.
