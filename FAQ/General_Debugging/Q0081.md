Question
--------

What does *error in redirect data: included file xxxx is too big* mean?

Answer
------

You are trying to include a very large file in a redirection list, using
the `:include:` feature. Exim has a built-in limit on the size, as a
safety precaution. The default is 1 megabyte. If you want to increase
this, you have to rebuild Exim. In your *Local/Makefile*, put

    MAX_INCLUDE_SIZE = whatever

and then rebuild Exim. The value is a number of bytes, but you can give
it as a parenthesized arithmetic expression such as `(3*1024*1024)`.
However, an included file of more than a megabyte is likely to be quite
inefficient. How many addresses does yours contain? You get the best
performance out of Exim if you arrange to send mailing list messages
with no more than about 100 recipients (in order to get parallelism in
the routing).
