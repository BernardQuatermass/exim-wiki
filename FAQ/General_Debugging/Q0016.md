Question
--------

I've set `verify = header_syntax` in my ACL, but this causes Exim to
complain about header lines like
`To: Work: Jim <jims@email>, Home: Bob <bobs@email>` which look all
right to me. Is this a bug?

Answer
------

No. Header lines such as *From:*, *To:*, etc., which contain addresses, are structured, and have to be in a specific format which is defined in RFC 2822. Unquoted colons are not allowed in the  phrase > part of an email address (they are OK in other headers such as
> *Subject:*). The correct form for that header is

    To: "Work: Jim" <jims@email>, "Home: Bob" <bobs@email>

You will sometimes see unquoted colons in *To:* and *Cc:* headers, but only in connection with name lists (called  groups ), for example:

    To: My friends: X <x@y.x>, Y <y@w.z>;,
        My enemies: A <a@b.c>, B <b@c.d>;

Each list must be terminated by a semicolon, as shown.
