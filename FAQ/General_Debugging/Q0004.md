Question
--------

My virtual domain setup isn't working. How can I debug it?

Answer
------

You can use an exim command with **-d** to get it to show you how it is
processing addresses. You don't actually need to send a message; use the
**-bt** option like this:

    exim -d -bt localpart@virtualhost

This will show you which routers it is using. If the problem appears to
be with the expansion of an option setting, you can use the
`debug_print` option on a router to get Exim to output the expanded
string values as it goes along.
