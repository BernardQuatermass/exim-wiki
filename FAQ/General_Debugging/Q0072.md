Q0072
=====

Question
--------

Exim will deliver to normal aliases, and aliases that are pipes or
files, but it objects to aliases that involve `:include:` items,
complaining that it can't change gid or uid. Why is this?

Answer
------

See \`../Q0066\`\_ for a general answer. The problem happens during
verification of an incoming SMTP message, not during delivery itself. In
this particular case, you must have set up your aliasing router with a
`user` setting. This causes Exim to change uid/gid when reading
`:include:` files. If you do not need the detailed verification provided
by the router, the easy solution is to set `no_verify` so that the
router isn't used during verification. Otherwise, if you set `user` on
the router in order to provide a user for delivery to pipes or files,
one solution is to put the `user` setting on the transports instead of
on the router. You may need to create some special transports just for
this router. The alternative is to supply two different routers, one
with `user` and `no_verify`, and the with `verify_only` but no `user`
setting.
