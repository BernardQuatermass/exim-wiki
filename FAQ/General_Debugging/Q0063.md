Q0063
=====

Question
--------

When I try to start an Exim daemon, nothing happens. There is no
process, and nothing is written to the Exim log.

Answer
------

Check to see if anything is written to *syslog*. This problem can be
caused by a permission problem that stops Exim from writing to its log
files, especially if you've specified that they should be written
somewhere other than under Exim's spool directory. You could also try
running the daemon with debugging turned on.
