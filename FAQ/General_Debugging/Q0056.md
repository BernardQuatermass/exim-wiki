Q0056
=====

Question
--------

We are using Exim to send mail from our web server. However, whenever a
user sends an email it gets sent with the return path (envelope sender)
[apache@server\_name.com](mailto:apache@server_name.com) because the PHP
script is running as *apache*.

Answer
------

You need to include *apache* in the `trusted_users` configuration
option. Only trusted users are permitted to specify senders when mail is
passed to Exim via the command line.
