Q0012

Question
--------

Exim is unable to route to any remote domains. It doesn't seen to be
able to access the DNS.

Answer
------

Try running `exim -d+resolver -bt ''remote address''`. The **-d**
options turns on debugging output, and the addition of `+resolver` will
make it show the resolver queries it is building and the results of its
DNS queries. If it appears unable to contact any name servers, check the
contents and permissions of */etc/resolv.conf*.
