Q0006
=====

Question
--------

I've put an entry for `*.my.domain` in a DBM lookup file, but it isn't
getting recognized.

Answer
------

You need to request .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

partial matching.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

> by setting the search type to `partial-dbm` in order for this to work.
