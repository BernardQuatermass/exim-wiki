Q0049
=====

Question
--------

What does the log message *no immediate delivery: more than 10 messages
received in one connection* mean?

Answer
------

A remote MTA sent a number of messages in a single SMTP session. Exim
limits the number of immediate delivery processes it creates as a result
of a single SMTP connection, in order to avoid creating a zillion
processes on systems that can have many incoming connections. If you are
dialing in to collect mail from your ISP, you should probably set
`smtp_accept_queue_per_connection` to some number larger than 10, or
arrange to start a queue runner for local delivery (using **-ql**)
immediately after collecting the mail.
