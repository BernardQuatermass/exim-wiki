Q0039
=====

Question
--------

I have installed Exim, but now I can't mail to *root* any more. Why is
this?

Answer
------

Most people set up *root* as an alias for the manager of the host. If
you haven't done this, Exim will attempt to deliver to *root* as if it
were a normal user. This isn't really a good idea because the delivery
process would run as *root*. Exim has two trigger guards that stop
deliveries running as root. In the build-time configuration, there is a
setting called FIXED\_NEVER\_USERS, which defaults to `root`. This
setting cannot be overridden. In addition, the default runtime
configuration contains the option

    never_users = root

just to be on the safe side. If you really want to run local deliveries
as *root*, you must use a version of Exim that was built without the
FIXED\_NEVER\_USERS option, and remove the above line from the runtime
configuration, but it would be better to create an alias for *root*
instead.
