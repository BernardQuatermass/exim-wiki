Q0053
=====

Question
--------

Exim on my host responds to a connection with `220 *****...` and won't
understand `EHLO` commands.

Answer
------

This is the sign of a Cisco Pix  Mailguard sitting in front of your MTA. Pix breaks ESMTP and only does SMTP. It is a nuisance when you have a secure MTA running on your box. Something like  no fixup protocol smtp 25 > in the Pix configuration is needed. It may be possible to do this by
> logging into the Pix (using *telnet* or *ssh*) and typing
> `no fixup smtp` to its console. (You may need to use other commands
> before or after to set up configuration mode and to activate a changed
> configuration. Consult your Pix documentation or expert.) See also
