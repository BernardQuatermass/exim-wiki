Q0053
=====

Question
--------

Answer
------

This is the sign of a Cisco Pix .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

Mailguard.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

sitting in front of your MTA. Pix breaks ESMTP and only does SMTP. It is a nuisance when you have a secure MTA running on your box. Something like .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

no fixup protocol smtp 25.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;
