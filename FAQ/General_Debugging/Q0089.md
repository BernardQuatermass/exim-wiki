Question
--------

What does the error *kernel: application bug: exim(12099) has SIGCHLD
set to SIG\_IGN but calls wait()* mean?

Answer
------

This was a bad interaction between a change to the Linux kernel and some  belt and braces programming in Exim. The following explanation is taken from Exim's change log: When Exim is receiving multiple messages on a single connection, and spinning off delivery processess, it sets the SIGCHLD signal handling to SIG\_IGN, because it doesn't want to wait for these processes. However, because on some OS this didn't work, it also has a paranoid call to *waitpid()* in the loop to reap any children that have finished. Some versions of Linux now complain (to the system log) about this  illogical > call to *waitpid()*. I have therefore put it inside a conditional
> compilation, and arranged for it to be omitted for Linux. I am pretty
> sure I caught all the places in Exim where this happened. However,
> there are still occasional reports of this error. I have not heard of
> any resolutions, but my current belief is that they are caused by
> something that Exim calls falling foul of the same check. There was at
> one time a suspicion that the IPv6 stack was involved.
