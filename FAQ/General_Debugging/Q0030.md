Q0030
=====

Question
--------

I'm trying to use a query-style lookup for hosts that are allowed to
relay, but it is giving really weird errors.

Answer
------

Does your query contain a colon character? Remember that host lists are
colon-separated, so you need to double any colons in the query. This
applies even if the query is defined as a macro.
