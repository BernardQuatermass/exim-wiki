Q0064
=====

Question
--------

When I run `exim -d test@domain` it delivers fine, but when I send a
message from the *mail* command, I get *User unknown* and the mail is
saved in *dead.letter*.

Answer
------

It looks as if Exim isn't being called by *mail*; instead it is calling
some other program (probably Sendmail). Try running the command

    /usr/sbin/sendmail -bV

(If you get *No such file or directory* or *Command not found* you are
running Solaris or IRIX. Try again with */usr/lib/sendmail*.) The output
should be something like this:

    Exim version 4.05 #1 built 13-Jun-2002 10:27:15
    Copyright (c) University of Cambridge 2002

If you don't see this, your Exim installation isn't fully operational.
If you are running FreeBSD, see \`FAQ/FreeBSD/Q9201\`\_. For other
systems, see \`FAQ/Building\_and\_Installing/Q0114\`\_.
