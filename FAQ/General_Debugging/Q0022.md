Q0022
=====

Question
--------

What does *No transport set by system filter* in a log line mean?

Answer
------

Your system filter contains a `pipe` or `save` or `mail` command, but
you have not set the corresponding option which specifies which
transport is to be used. You need to set whichever of
`system_filter_pipe_transport`, `system_filter_file_transport` or
`system_filter_reply_transport` is relevant.
