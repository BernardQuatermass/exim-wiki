Q0011
=====

Question
--------

Instead of *exim\_dbmbuild*, I'm using a homegrown program to build DBM
(or cdb) files, but Exim doesn't seem to be able to use them.

Answer
------

Exim expects there to be a binary zero value on the end of each key used
in a DBM file if you use the `dbm` lookup type, but not for the `dbmnz`
lookup type or for the keys of a cdb file. Check that you haven't
slipped up in this regard.
