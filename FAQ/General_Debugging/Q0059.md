Q0059

Question
--------

When my Outlook Express 6.0 client sends a STARTTLS command to begin a
TLS session, Exim doesn't seem to receive it. The Outlook log shows
this:

    SMTP: 14:19:27 [tx] STARTTLS
    SMTP: 14:19:27 [rx] 500 Unsupported command.

but the Exim debugging output shows this:

    SMTP<< EHLO xxxx
    SMTP>> 250-yyyy Hello xxxx [nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn]
    250-SIZE 52428800
    250-PIPELINING
    250-AUTH CRAM-MD5 PLAIN LOGIN
    250-STARTTLS
    250 HELP
    SMTP<< QUIT

Answer
------

Turn off scanning of outgoing email in Norton Antivirus. If you aren't running Norton Antivirus, see if you are running some other kind of SMTP proxying, either on the client or on a firewall between the client and server.  Unsupported command > is not an Exim message.
