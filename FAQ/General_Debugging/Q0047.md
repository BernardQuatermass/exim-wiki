Q0047
=====

Question
--------

On a reboot, or a restart of the mail system, I see the message *Mailer
daemons: exim abandoned: unknown, malformed, or incomplete option -bz
sendmail*. What does this mean?

Answer
------

**-bz** is a Sendmail option requesting it to create a \`configuration
freeze file'. Exim has no such concept and so does not support the
option. You probably have a line like

    /usr/lib/sendmail -bz

in some start-up script (e.g. */etc/init.d/mail*) immedately before

    /usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q15m

The first of these lines should be commented out.
