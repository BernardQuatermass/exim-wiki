Question
--------

What does the error **Too many Received headers - suspected mail loop** mean?

Answer
------

Whenever a message passes through an MTA, a *Received:* header gets
added. Exim counts the number of these headers in incoming messages. If
there are more than the value of `received_headers_max` (default 30),
Exim assumes there is some kind of mail routing loop occurring. For
example, host A passes the message to host B, which immediately passes
it back to host A. Check the *Received:* headers and the mail logs to
determine exactly what is going on. One common cause of this problem is
users with accounts on both systems who set up each one to forward to
the other, thinking that will cause copies of all messages to be
delivered on both of them.
