Q0034
=====

Question
--------

Exim works fine on one host, but when I copied the binary to another
identical host, it stopped working (it could not resolve DNS names).

Answer
------

Is the new host running exactly the same operating system? Most
importantly, are the versions of the dynamically loaded libraries (files
with names like *libsocket.so.1*) the same on both systems? If not, that
is probably the cause of the problem. Either arrange for the libraries
to be the same, or rebuild Exim from source on the new host.
