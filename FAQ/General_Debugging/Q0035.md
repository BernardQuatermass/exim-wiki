Q0035
=====

Question
--------

I set a `hosts` condition in an ACL to do a lookup in a file of IP
addresses, but it doesn't work.

Answer
------

Did you remember to put `net-` at the start of the the search type? If
you set something like this:

    accept hosts = lsearch;/some/file

Exim searches the file for the host name, not the IP address. You need
to set

    accept hosts = net-lsearch;/some/file

to make it use the IP address as the key to the lookup.
