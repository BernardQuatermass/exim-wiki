Q0041
=====

Question
--------

What does the message *unable to set gid=ddd or uid=ddd (euid=ddd):
local delivery to ... transport=ttt* mean?

Answer
------

Have you remembered to make Exim setuid *root*? It needs root privilege if it is to do any local deliveries, because it does them .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

as the user.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

. Note also that the partition from which Exim is running (where the
binary is installed) must not have the `nosuid` mount option set. You
can check this by looking at its */etc/fstab* entry (or */etc/vfstab*,
depending on your OS).
