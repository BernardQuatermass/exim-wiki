Question
--------

Why is Exim refusing to relay, saying *failed to find host name from IP
address* when I have the sender's IP address in an ACL condition? My
configuration contains this ACL statement:

    accept hosts = lsearch;/etc/mail/relaydomains:192.168.96.0/24

Answer
------

When checking a host list, the items are tested in left-to-right order.
The first item in your list is a lookup on the incoming host's name, so
Exim has to determine the name from the incoming IP address in order to
perform the test. If it can't find the host name, it can't do the check,
so it gives up. You would have discovered what was going on if you had
run a test such as

    exim -bh 192.168.96.131

The solution is to put all explicit IP addresses first in the list.
Alternatively, you can split the ACL statement into two like this:

    accept hosts = lsearch;/etc/mail/relaydomains
    accept hosts = 192.168.96.0/24

If the host lookup fails, the first `accept` fails, but then the second
one is considered.
