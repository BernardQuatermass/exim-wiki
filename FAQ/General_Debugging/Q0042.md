Q0042
=====

Question
--------

My ISP's mail server is rejecting bounce messages from Exim, complaining
that they have no sender. The SMTP trace does indeed show that the
sender address is `<>`. Why is the Sender on the bounce message empty?

Answer
------

Because the RFCs say it must be. Your ISP is at fault. Send them this
extract from RFC 2821 section 6.1 (*Reliable Delivery and Replies by
Email*): If there is a delivery failure after acceptance of a message,
the receiver-SMTP MUST formulate and mail a notification message. This
notification MUST be sent using a null (`<>`) reverse path in the
envelope. The recipient of this notification MUST be the address from
the envelope return path (or the *Return-Path:* header line). However,
if this address is null (`<>`), the receiver-SMTP MUST NOT send a
notification. The reason that bounce messages have no sender is so that
they themselves cannot provoke further bounces, as this could lead to a
unending exchange of undeliverable messages.
