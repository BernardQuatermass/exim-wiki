Q0073
=====

Question
--------

I'm seeing log file corruption, with parts of log lines getting mangled
by other log entries.

Answer
------

The only time this has been seen is when several servers were writing to
the same log files over NFS. Exim assumes that its log file is on local
disk, and using NFS, especially for more than one server, will not work.
