Q0084

Question
--------

I want to set up an alias that pipes a message to *gpg* and then pipes
the result to *mailx* to resubmit the message, but when I use my tested
command in an alias file, I get an error from *gpg*.

Answer
------

Probably you are using a shell command with two pipe symbols in it. An
alias like this:

    gpg-xxx: "|gpg <options> | mailx <options"

does not work, because Exim does not run pipes under a shell by default.
You must call a shell explicitly if you want to make use of the shell's
features for double-piping, either by piping to `/bin/sh` with a
suitable `-c` option, or by piping to a shell script.
