Q0078
=====

Question
--------

Exim is logging the unknown SMTP command `XXXX` from my client hosts,
and they are unable to authenticate.

Answer
------

This is a sign of a Cisco PIX firewall getting in the way. It does not
support ESMTP, and turns EHLO commands into XXXX. You should configure
the Pix to leave SMTP alone; see \`../Q0053\`\_ for how to do this.
