Q0092
=====

Question
--------

The error message *Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.* occurs
when I try to use Exim with PostgreSQL.

Answer
------

Check that you have not set

    log_statement=true

in the PostgreSQL configuration file. It seems that this causes
PostgreSQL to return logging information as the first row in a query
result, which totally confuses Exim.
