Question
--------

When I try to start an Exim daemon with **-bd** it crashes. I ran a
debugger and discovered that the crash is happening in the function
*getservbyname()*. What's going on?

Answer
------

What have you got in the file */etc/nsswitch.conf*? If it contains this
line:

    services:       db files

try removing the `db`. Your system is trying to look in some kind of
database before searching the file */etc/services*, and there is an
incompatibility the is causing the function *getservbyname()* crash.
This is an OS problem. See, for instance:
[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=129025](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=129025)
Another workaround in Exim is to set

    daemon_smtp_port = 25

in the configuration, to stop Exim calling *getservbyname()*.
