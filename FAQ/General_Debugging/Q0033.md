Q0033
=====

Question
--------

What does the error *lookup of host "xx.xx.xx" failed in yyy router*
mean?

Answer
------

You configured a **manualroute** router to send the message to xx.xx.xx.
When it tried to look up the IP address for that host, the lookup failed
with a permanent error. As this is a manual routing, this is a
considered to be a serious error which the postmaster needs to know
about (maybe you have a typo in your file), and there is little point in
keeping on trying. So it freezes the message.

1.  Don't set up routes to non-existent hosts.

2.  If you must set up routes to non-existent hosts, and don't want
    zing, set the `host_find_failed` option on the router to do
    something r than freeze.
