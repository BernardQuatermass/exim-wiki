Q0031
=====

Question
--------

Exim is rejecting connections from hosts that have more than one IP
address, for no apparent reason.

Answer
------

You are using Solaris 7 or earlier, and have `nis dns files` in
*/etc/nsswitch.conf*. Change this to `dns nis files` to avoid hitting
Sun bug 1154236 (a bad interaction between NIS and the DNS).
