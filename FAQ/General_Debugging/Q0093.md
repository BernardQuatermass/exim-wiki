Q0093
=====

Question
--------

Why is email not being received? Messages are being lost with no entry
in the mail log.

Answer
------

Enabling the Exim feature "Sender Verification Callouts" can cause this,
and it is not clear how to debug this problem, since the sender receives
a 550 error code but no entry is made in the receiver's mail log.

This can be solved by disabling this feature in your Exim configuration.
Note that it is not necessary to disable the entire "Sender
Verification" feature.
