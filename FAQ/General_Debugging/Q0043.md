Question
--------

What does the error *Unable to get interface configuration: 22 Invalid
argument* mean?

Answer
------

This is an error that occurs when Exim is trying to find out the all the
IP addresses on all of the local host's interfaces. If you have lots of
virtual interfaces, this can occur if there are more than around 250 of
them. The solution is to set the option `local_interfaces` to list just
those IP addresses that you want to use for making and receiving SMTP
connections.
