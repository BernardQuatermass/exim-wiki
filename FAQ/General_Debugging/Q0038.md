Question
--------

What does the error message *error in forward file (filtering not
enabled): missing or malformed local part* mean?

Answer
------

If you are trying to use an Exim filter, you have forgotten to enable
the facility, which is disabled by default. In the **redirect** router
(in the Exim run time configuration file) you need to set

    allow_filter = true

to allow a *.forward* file to be used as an Exim filter. If you are not
trying to use an Exim filter, then you have put a malformed address in
the *.forward* file.
