Q0060
=====

Question
--------

Why am I getting the error *failed to expand* `/data/lists/lists/${lc`
*for require\_files:* `${lc` *is not a known operator* for this setting:

    require_files = MAILMAN_HOME/lists/${lc:$local_part}/config.db

Answer
------

The value of `require_files` is a list in which each item is separately
expanded. In other words, the splitting into items happens before the
string expansion. You need either to double the colon, or switch to a
different list separator.
