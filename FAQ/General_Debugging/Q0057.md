Q0057
=====

Question
--------

We've got people complaining about attachments that don't show up as
attachments, but are included in the body of the message.

Answer
------

In the past, these symptoms could be seen when some software passed a
CRLF line terminated message via the command line, because Exim expected
lines to be terminated by LF only, and so it preserved the CRs as data.
Modern versions of Exim (4.21 or later) use heuristics to try to do the
right thing with line endings.
