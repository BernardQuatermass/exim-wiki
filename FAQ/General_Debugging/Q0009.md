Q0009
=====

Question
--------

What does *no immediate delivery: too many messages received in one SMTP
connection* mean?

Answer
------

An SMTP client may send any number of messages down a single SMTP
connection to a server. Initially, an Exim server starts up a delivery
process as soon as a message is received. However, in order not to start
up too many processes when lots of messages are arriving (typically
after a period of downtime), it stops doing immediate delivery after a
certain number of messages have arrived down the same connection. The
threshold is set by `smtp_accept_queue_per_connection`, and the default
value is 10. On large systems, the value should be increased. If you are
running a dial-in host and expecting to get all your mail down a single
SMTP connection, then you can disable the limit altogether by setting
the value to zero.
