Q0076
=====

Question
--------

I've configured Exim to use *syslog* for its logs, with the main and
reject logs sent to different files, but whenever a message is rejected,
I get one message on the reject log and two messages on the main log.

Answer
------

You are probably putting your reject items into the main log as well;
remember *syslog* levels are inclusive (for example, `mail.info`
includes all higher levels, so a `mail.notice` message will be caught by
a `mail.info` descriptor). Test this by running the command:

    logger -p mail.notice test

and seeing which logs it goes into. From Exim release 4.31 it is
possible to disable the rejectlog by setting `write_rejectlog` false.
