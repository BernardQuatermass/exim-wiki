(1) There is useful advice on this web page:
    [http://www.afp548.com/Articles/Jaguar/exim410.html](http://www.afp548.com/Articles/Jaguar/exim410.html).

1.  There is a package installer available at this URL:
    p://members.aol.com/AFP548dotcom/EximInstaller.sit?.

2.  There is another package installer for the combination of MySQL, ,
    Exiscan, CourierIMAP, and SpamAssassin\_ at this URL:
    tp://maxo.captainnet.net/installs/mail-install.html?.

MacOSX is similar to FreeBSD, so the general Unix installation
instructions apply. However, eximon doesn't compile, so don't try to
install that. Geximon works reasonably well, though, and is a good
replacement for eximon.

There's also an exim port in the MacPorts\_ project.
