Question
--------

When using \${perl, clients sometimes disconnect having been fed
garbage. This is because perl's STDERR (where warnings generated by perl
libraries go) is connected to the SMTP socket. How can I fix this?

Answer
------

In the Perl script, set the following, which causes warnings to be
logged by Exim.

    $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { Exim::log_write($_[0]) };
