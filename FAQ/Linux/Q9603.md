Question
--------

I'm seeing the message *inetd[334]: imap/tcp server failing (looping),
service terminated* on a RedHat\_ 5.2 system, causing *imap* connections
to be refused. The *imapd* in use is Washington Univers 12.250. Could
this be anything to do with Exim?

Answer
------

No, it's nothing to do with Exim, but here's the answer anyway: there is
a maximum connection rate for *inetd*. If connections come in faster
than that, it thinks a caller is looping. The default setting on
RedHat\_ 5.2 is 40 calls in any one minute before *inetd* thinks there's
a problem and suspends further calls for 10 mins. This default setting
is very conservative. You should probably increase it by a factor of 10
or 20. For example:

    imap stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/etc/imapd

The rate setting is the number following .. raw:: html
:   &\#147;

nowait.. raw:: html
:   &\#148;

. This syntax seems to be specific to the Linux version of *inetd*.
Other operating systems provide similar functionality, but in different
ways.
