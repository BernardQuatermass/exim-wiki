Question
--------

Exim is mysteriously crashing, usually when forking to send a delivery
error message.

Answer
------

This has been seen in cases where Exim has been incorrectly built with a
muddled combination of an *ndbm.h* include file and a non-matching DBM
library. Faults like this have also been seen on systems with faulty
motherboards. You could try to compile the Linux kernel 10 times - if
the compile process stops with signal 11, your hardware is to blame.
