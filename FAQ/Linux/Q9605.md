Question
--------

I installed debian 2.2 linux on a small 325mb 486 laptop. When I try to
test the Mail program, I get the following error: *Failed to open
configuration file /etc/exim.conf*.

Answer
------

The Debian installation should have given you */usr/sbin/eximconfig*,
which asks you some questions and then sets up the configuration file in
*/etc/exim.conf*. Try running that (you'll probably need *root*) and see
how it goes. In any case you get a thoroughly commented conf file at the
end, which will give you a sample from which to work if you need further
modification. The Exim docs in the Debian package are in */usr/doc/exim*
where the full reference manual is *spec.txt.gz*.
