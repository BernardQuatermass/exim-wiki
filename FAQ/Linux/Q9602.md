Question
--------

I want to use *logrotate* which is standard with RH5.2 Linux to rotate
my mail logs. Anyone worked out the *logrotate* config file that will do
this?

Answer
------

Here's one suggestion:

    /var/log/exim/main.log {
        create 644 exim exim
        rotate 4
        compress
        delaycompress
    }

The sleep is added to allow things to close the log file prior to
compression. You also need similar entries for the panic log and the
reject log, of course.
