Question
--------

When I run fetchmail, I get the error *SMTP listener doesn't like
recipient address xxx@localhost*.

Answer
------

Make sure that *localhost* is recognized as a domain that is to be
delivered locally. If you are using the default Exim run time
configuration, you'll see a line near the top like this:

    domainlist local_domains = @

Change it to

    domainlist local_domains = @ : localhost
