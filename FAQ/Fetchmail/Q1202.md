Q1202
=====

Question
--------

I'm currently using Exim with fetchmail and I'd like to use the RBL on
Exim, but will it work? Do I need to configure fetchmail any particular
way? As far as Exim knows, all mail is coming from 127.0.0.1. Will it
check the source address against RBL? Or will it check the *From:*
header?

Answer
------

It will check 127.0.0.1 (not very useful). The point of the RBL is to
keep messages from black-listed hosts out of your machine. If you are
using fetchmail, you receive the messages onto your machine before you
approach Exim. That kind of defeats the purpose of the RBL. The right
way to do this would be for the host from which you fetch your mail to
do the RBL checking and insert some kind of warning header for you to
test, as Exim does if you run RBL checks in warning mode.
