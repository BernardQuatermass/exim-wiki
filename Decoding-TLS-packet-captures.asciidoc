Wireshark can, with enough info (the cipher keys), decode TLS.

- TLS 1.2 using an RSA key: add the private-key PEM-format file to the **RSA Keys** list
- TLS 1.2 (any key, including ECDHE): from the debug ouput grab a line with either
~~~
RSA Session-ID: Master-Key:
~~~
with two long hex numbers, or
~~~
CLIENT_RANDOM
~~~
with two long hex numbers. Put that into a file and give the filename as the **(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename**.
- TLS 1.3: from the debug ouput grab five lines:
~~~
SERVER_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET
EXPORTER_SECRET
SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0
CLIENT_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET
CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0
~~~
each with a long hex number. File as above.
