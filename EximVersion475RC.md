Release Candidate verification status for Exim version 4.75

Per the Exim Release Policy [nb: not yet approved], we expect there to
normally be at least one week between the release of the first Release
Candidate (RC) for a new release and the final release. The policy
states:

> &ldquo;
>
> *Those who test RCs get to ensure that their platform is a first-class supported platform for a release, and the final release should be cleanly buildable and working on their platform*.. raw:: html
> :   &rdquo;

We attempt to work with OS packagers who work with us, and if time
permits we will try to chase up to get a response from the OSes listed
here, if there is a contact name to reach (and a reasonable chance of us
determining your email address). The template version of this document
includes those OSes who wish to be contacted for a new release.
Packagers signing off on a particular release may add themselves here
and to the template for future releases, as they see fit.

We also like testing from people who actively use an operating-system,
but are unlikely to chase after them for a response.

Table mostly sorted alphabetically by OS; specific versions after the
general case or "official maintainer"

**Abuse**

Abuse of the wiki authorisation model will lead to an upset Release
Engineer and probably a disinclination to work with that party in the
future.
