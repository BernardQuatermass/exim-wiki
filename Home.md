We are currently building out this wiki as we migrate content from our old one, with appropriate rewrites and replacements.

For finding resources, try [[What Lives Where On The Web]] which describes where the website is, why there are currently two wikis, where to find mailing-lists, source code, bug-tracking, etc.

For folks wanting assistance, we suggest [[Exim Mailing Lists]], together with [[Mailing List Etiquette]] and [[Mailing List Policies]].

For folks wishing to contribute code or other development resources, we suggest [[Exim Development]].

Remember, in Exim the documentation is called _The Exim Specification_ for a reason: if code does not match the documentation, whether because of differences or incomplete documentation, that is unambiguously a bug. The bug might be in the documentation, it might be in the code, but documentation is a first class priority of the project.  We want this wiki to be a useful resource, but also want to ensure that the Specification remains up-to-date.
