Experimental Features
=====================

From time to time, experimental features may be added to Exim. While a
feature is experimental, there will be a build-time option whose name
starts "EXPERIMENTAL\_" that must be set in order to include the
feature. This file contains information about experimental features, all
of which are unstable and liable to incompatible change.

Experimental features are not documented in the mail Exim docs, but the
latest documentation on them is available in the distribution:
exim/exim-doc/doc-txt/experimental-spec.txt
-   Yahoo [DomainKeys](DomainKeys)
-   [Brightmail AntiSpam](BrightMail)
-   Sender Rewriting Scheme [SRS](SRS)
