Exim 3 on Debian GNU/Linux
==========================

exim 3 is the default MTA for the current stable version of Debian
GNU/Linux, woody. This is a bad thing since exim 3 has no support any
more from the exim upstream.

If you have a problem with exim 3 on Debian, please do not ask on the
exim-users mailing list. You might get help on the Debian exim 4 users
mailing list.

Debian testing and unstable have exim 3 packages. They are provided to
aid updating from woody. Do not use them for new installations, and
please consider updating to [exim
4](http://pkg-exim4.alioth.debian.org/) as soon as possible.

The Debian exim 4 maintainers have packages for the current stable
version, woody, available and try to support them as well as the
development versions. You can apt them from
