With each release of Exim, three files are relevant for understanding changes.
We link here to the current versions in Git, but all come as part of the release tarballs.

* [README.UPDATING](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/src/README.UPDATING) provides warnings of backwards incompatibilities which should be carefully understood before updating.

* [NewStuff](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/doc/doc-txt/NewStuff) file describes new features with each version of Exim.

* [ChangeLog](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/doc/doc-txt/ChangeLog) file describes all non-trivial changes, including reworkings, new features, bug fixes, and security fixes.

The `README.UPDATING` file can be found in the top-level directory of the releases; the others can be found in the `doc/` sub-directory.
