`exim-snmp-stats` is a set of scripts written by [Matthew
Newton](http://www.le.ac.uk/users/mcn4/) of the [University of
Leicester](http://www.le.ac.uk/) to get statistics from the Exim log
file and the current queue, and then report it via the NET-SNMP daemon.
The data can then be graphed with something like Cacti.

The tarball contains the script, a screen shot of the graphs, and some
rough instructions on how to install it. There is also an XML file
exported from Cacti that should give a new "Exim host", ready for the
SNMP data.

Sample output can be seen on the [exim-snmp-stats
page](http://www.le.ac.uk/users/mcn4/exim-snmp-stats/)
