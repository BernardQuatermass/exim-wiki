# Mailing List Policies

Details of policies applied to the [[Exim Mailing Lists]].  You will also find it instructive to read [[Mailing List Etiquette]] for the social rules used on the list.

## Archiving

All the lists are archived.  All the archives, except that for `exim-maintainers`, are public.

Posting to the list is taken as permission to post the message to the archive, additionally you are informed when joining the list that the list is publicly archived.

Requests to have information removed from the archives are not welcomed as they create significant work for maintainers and are a rewriting of history.  In cases of accidental exposure of confidential information archive removal will be looked at, however many other sites also archive our lists and removing exposed information can never be fully effective.

A number of organisations not connected with Exim provide public archive services for a number of mailing-lists.  We welcome this for our public lists.

## Posting

All lists require you to be a member to post directly (and that is not sufficient for `exim-announce` which is fully moderated).  A non-member posting to the list will find that their posting is moderated.

Posts that look like spam, have too many addresses in the To/Cc headers, are from suspect addresses etc may also be moderated.

Posts from new subscribers are moderated, but after a couple of non-spam posts the moderation bit will typically be cleared.

### Moderated Posts

_This policy has changed in October 2006 - this information reflects current policy_

* No message is sent to a user who has a post held for moderation (this is to prevent backscatter spam)
* Moderators are given a summary of held messages once a day - they can then allow moderated messages through.
* Thus a moderated message _just disappears_ for a while.  This is not a good situation but cannot be improved without full time moderators or without creating backscatter spam.

Please do not resend moderated requests _unless_ you realise that the original was from an unsubscribed address - in this case you may find the original gets posted too since moderators do not necessarily remember every message that has hit the list.
